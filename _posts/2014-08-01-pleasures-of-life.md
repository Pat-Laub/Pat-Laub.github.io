Midway through honours, I stumbled across a gem of a book in an underground second-hand book store in Melbourne. Written by a long-dead English gentleman, [__The Pleasures of Life__](/pdfs/pleasures_of_life_a5.pdf) simply lists all the enjoyable aspects of being alive with heavy use of quotations from the canon. From the preface, the author explains:

"Having been myself when young rather prone to
suffer from low spirits, I have at several of these
gatherings taken the opportunity of dwelling on
the privileges and blessings we enjoy, and I reprint
here the substance of some of these addresses
(omitting what was special to the circumstances of
each case, and freely making any alterations and
additions which have since occurred to me), hoping
that the thoughts and quotations in which I
have myself found most comfort may perhaps be of
use to others also."

I gifted my copy of the book to a close friend, but then couldn't find another copy to replace it, so re-typeset the text found on [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/7952) in an old-timey font as close as possible to my original copy. It took a non-trivial amount of time, I remember the abundance of footnotes were the most difficult to replicate; the [__A5-sized version__](/pdfs/pleasures_of_life_a5.pdf) and the [__A4-sized version__](/pdfs/pleasures_of_life_a4.pdf) are here. The pièce de résistance was [Rob Salomone](https://acems.org.au/our-people/robert-salomone)'s photoshopping of an ancient portrait of the author into the sketch above.

Rob couldn't help but give me the same treatment (below), and he called me Sir Patrick Laubbøck for the next few months ha.
