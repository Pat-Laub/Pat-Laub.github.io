excerpt: >
        The book explores the history of science from a new and deliberately wider focus, including the fact that these inventors were real people with tumultuous love lives, medical crises, and powerful personalities. It highlights that a scientist needs to be much more than a Spock-like analytical reasoning engine, that he/she requires diplomacy, creativity, art, the ability to articulate findings to the public, and, not-least, funding.

There are some rare and peculiar emotions which are nearly impossible to describe. Scientists and engineers – contrary to their popular perception of robotic coldness – can claim a sizeable share of these emotions, chief among them being the so-called ‘Eureka moment’ of discovery and understanding. The Age of Wonder beautifully catalogues some of these deeply personal moments of pioneers from the ‘revolution of Romantic Science’ (about 1780-1820).

Holmes’ story begins with an account of naturalist (later-Sir) Joseph Banks on Captain Cook’s first great voyage (1768–1771) on the HMS Endeavour. This launched Banks to fame and to high office (President of the Royal Society). The focus is on the months spent in Tahiti; the Mad King George had funded the trip so the transit of Venus across the sun could be documented. Here, the 26-year-old Banks ‘went native’, practising the language and customs (particularly the famed libidinousness) of the local tribesmen.

Later, we hear an account of the (hot-air) “ballooning craze” that swept across France and Britain. We follow the courageous/mad Frenchmen de Rozier and Marquis d'Arlandes in the world’s first human flight across Paris strapped to a Montgolfier balloon (1783). However, my favourite anecdote was of Jefferies and Blanchard in the first balloon crossing of the English Channel (1785); after lifting off from Dover they’d started losing altitude, and took some hilarious/desperate measures to lighten the balloon (including “a kind of aerial strip-tease” and even some “careful urination”), only barely avoiding the channel waters and a dangerous descent at Calais. 

We follow William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus, Mungo Park’s African adventures, and Sir Humphrey Davy’s invention of modern chemistry – early experiments on newly discovered gases (such as nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide) had Humphrey simply breathing these totally unknown gases! Holmes ends with the ‘vitalism debate’, a now-abandoned theory of ‘life force’ under which Dr Frankenstein’s reanimated monster could (possibly) be considered scientifically plausible. 

The book explores the history of science from a new and deliberately wider focus, including the fact that these inventors were real people with tumultuous love lives, medical crises, and powerful personalities. It highlights that a scientist needs to be much more than a Spock-like analytical reasoning engine, that he/she requires diplomacy, creativity, art, the ability to articulate findings to the public, and, not-least, funding. 

To conclude, this is my favourite non-fiction book to date. I would recommend it to readers from any background; its target audience is not some narrow spectrum of scientists and technologists (it seems the author typically writes biographies of Romantic poets). As a quasi-scientist (a mathematician), reading The Age of Wonder has lifted my spirits during the cyclical malaise caused by a life of research. It reminds one of the sublime, the wonder, the beauty of understanding some of the world’s many mysteries.
