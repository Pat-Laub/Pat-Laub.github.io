Ten mathematicians living off the land for a week in Greenland.. The [__photos we got were amazing__](https://www.flickr.com/photos/32911979@N00/collections/72157680705107283/); [Leonardo](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/staff/leonardo-rojas-nandayapa/) did a great job of collating and editing them.   

My mate Elliot was going to write a satirical/horror story based off this since it seemed so improbable (he assured me that, no matter which approach he took, the character version of me would get killed off for sure). 

The reason we were all in Greenland was to attend the [Applied Probability Symposium](http://thiele.au.dk/events/conferences/2016/ilulissat/) at [Ilulissat](https://www.flickr.com/photos/32911979@N00/sets/72157671794657990) which was a celebration for SÃ¸ren Asmussen's 70th birthday. I presented [a talk](/pdfs/greenland.pdf) at the conference --- [here are all the speakers in action](https://www.flickr.com/photos/32911979@N00/sets/72157672172055201).
