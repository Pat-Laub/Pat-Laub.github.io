Some days in the PhD you really look for anything to do that isn't research.. I spent one of them making an updated homepage for my supervisor Søren Asmussen. The content is the same as the [original site](http://home.math.au.dk/asmus/), but I just added some of his old photos to [my new version](/soren/index.html).
