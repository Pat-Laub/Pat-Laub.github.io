The UQ maths & physics poster day was fun! I showed some nice work that [Pierre-Olivier](http://pierre-olivier.goffard.me/), [SÃ¸ren](http://home.math.au.dk/asmus/) & I did which is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01763); I tried to make [__my poster__]({% link /pdfs/sln_density_poster.pdf %}) as accessible as possible.
