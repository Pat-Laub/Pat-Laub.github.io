Click [__here to see some of my favourite photos__]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolios/decade/) which I took over the last decade.  The code I used is based on [alexivkin's plugin](https://github.com/alexivkin/Jekyll-Art-Gallery-Plugin) and [fancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/), both of which I found great and easy to setup.
