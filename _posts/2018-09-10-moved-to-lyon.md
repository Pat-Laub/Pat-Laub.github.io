I have started a post-doctoral position at the [__Chair for Data Analytics & Models for Insurance__](http://chaire-dami.fr/en/) (Chaire-DAMI), which is associated with the [__Institut de Science Financière et d'Assurances__](https://isfa.univ-lyon1.fr/) (ISFA) at the [__Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1__](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/en/) in Lyon, France.

My job is to research advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms for actuarial sciences and insurance, in particular, for improving risk-based pricing, and for developing predictive analytics.

I'm looking forward to spending two years in this beautiful city!
