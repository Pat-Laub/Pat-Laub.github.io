This animation is extracted from my updated rare-event estimation short course for masters students.
It shows the progression of the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm (for rare events). I'm quite happy with the [__video__](https://youtu.be/rnrAwAiBvqg) I recorded to describe this algorithm, as I am with the [__PyMC3 video__](https://youtu.be/tuXXubOkFuY) I made (recreating a fit for the COVID-19 incubation period distribution in PyMC3) and the final video on [__high-performance Python__](https://youtu.be/KbarEA6Edoo) (profiling tools, vectorisation, Numba, just single-core improvements). All of the materials and code demonstration recordings for the course are on the [__course website__](https://pat-laub.github.io/rare-events/).
