Problem
=======

Consider minimising the test function – named Rastrigin’s function –
defined by

$$S(x) = 20 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 10\cos(2\pi x_1) - 10\cos(2\pi x_2).$$

This is how it looks:

One cross-entropy approach could be as follows.


Formulation
===========

State that

$$S(x^*) = \gamma^* = \max_{ x\in {\mathbb{R}}^2} S(x).$$

Consider a family of pdfs
$\\{ f(\cdot\,; v) : v \in \mathcal{V} \\}$ on
${\mathbb{R}}^2$. We will construct a sequence of pdfs

$$(f(\cdot\,; u), f(\cdot\,; v_1), f(\cdot\,; v_2), \dots, f(\cdot\,; v_N))$$

which start with parameter $u=v_0$ and aim
to converge on the zero-variance distribution whose mass is on the point
$x^*$. In order to do this, we need to be able to solve
the program:

$$\boldsymbol{v}_t = \underset{ v}{\arg\max} \, \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I_{\\{S(X_i) \geq \hat{\gamma}_t\\}} \ln f(X_i; v) $$

where the $\{ X_i \}  {\overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}} f(\cdot\,; v_{t-1})$.

Though this is simpler when $v_t$ is viewed as the
maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of $\\{ X_i \\}$, which
is known analytically for many distributions.
In this case we’ve chosen $f$ to be of family of bivariate normal
distributions, i.e.

$$f(x; v_i) = f(x; (\mu_i, \Sigma_i)) = (2\pi)^{-1} \Sigma_i^{-1/2} \exp \left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (x-\mu_i)^t \Sigma_i^{-1} (x-\mu_i) \right\}.$$

The MLEs for $\mu_i$ and $\Sigma_i$ given some data
$\\{ X_i\\}$ is simply the sample mean and the sample
covariance matrix respectively.

Implementation
==============

These are the samples evolving over time.

For those samples, these are the multivariate normal distributions which are fitted to the elite samples.

The objective function drops across iterations.

This is the same plot as above but on a log scale.
