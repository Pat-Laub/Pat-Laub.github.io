Hi! I'm Pat Laub, a mathematician & software engineer currently finishing a PhD in applied probability (with a focus on computational methods).
My PhD jointly between Aarhus University and University of Queensland, and I'm lucky to have as supervisors [Søren Asmussen](http://home.math.au.dk/asmus/) and [Phil Pollett](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/PhilipPollett/).
I'm interested complex systems, and the intersection of maths/stats and computing, for example: computational and experimental maths, machine learning, statistics (MCMC), economics, artificial intelligence.
I like to read about biology (mainly genetics), history, and international relations.
I have worked in software roles, at Google & Data61 (then called NICTA), and have taught programming and probability at my universities over 8 years.
