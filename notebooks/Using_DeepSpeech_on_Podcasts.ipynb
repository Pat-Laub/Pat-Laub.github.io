            "mademoiselle wide debaters your face with tobacco manufactories still wept devilsdust wellmere coming in hot areas when sarah kuenstlertheater antecedents how you can work on a team effectively missus allandale repose that i read that connie a little upset at how this person was talking about some of their team mates so i wanted to take some time to dive into this topic and how we respect and work with our tea mate to share goals that my name is scotland sky and i'm a developer from denver colorado and with me as always is was ballasted worked on many teams in the past but and i work with my sister and how meaningless to see what tipsy got here yet it's fun because you know i've always i've always felt like a man pretty good team player in the web world but like i never knew that i had any sort of i don't know any sort of like form ideas but then when i posted my my here's here's how i think this person should have handled the situation to that readiest like the number one comment on it was this death teams and as i had like four hundred about like some brown they really related with with a mariposa that's great this episode is sponsored by two amazing companies both as companies century hand sanity now century is the place to see all of your errors in exceptions happen in your website application or whatever in fact we used intent or i as well as our ap and it's a lot of fun to see those errors in fact this is really this is a perfect use case for century the other day then he was friday and insomnia was deploying on friday but i had been seeing this century are that was really kind of a dumb one so that i fixed it and i pushed it up and then i marked it as resolved in my century yoke missus resolved i can go home now and be happy about my work for the week end then i got an email from century may be like two hours later in his as regression this bug that you had resolved the sinno resolved happening and as it talking about is very clearly i put a conditional in there i should no longer there's no way to irishmen and that's when i realized i only pushed the staging and never push to production so sintram bacon there because it there i was able to find out that i saw the air and exactly why the hero wasn't solved thanks to their awesome system of marking something as fixed and then that complaining about regression so that's right if you have any ireson had undecent that i owe you to coupon co taste treat all lower case all one word and you'll get to months for free than it may be centuries save your bacon like it save mine we are also sponsored by sandy what a standin sanity is a service that hold your content gives you an entire you i for editing all of your content you can olioll your images to sanity you can create all your contention relate all of them together and you can't create work flows in terms of what the approval process looks like you footler all that it's also my besique dons myself you want to check it out for your own if you've got an a that you want to push and you need a back in for that if you've got a marketing website that your your company is going to be doing if you are working on commerce you name it sandy is the one that you need go to sandy otford lash intact that is going to give you double the free usage tear forty sweet this is one little one pretty sweet thing that they just did is if you want to use this sanity coupon coat you can run and pimental dash sanity salian then you can stand it and it with the coupon coddin the salii think that's one of our first sponsors that has put the sentence in the sly or go sanity too for such an taxes how you can do that pretty sweet nice cool okay so let's good started here i do want to talk a little bit about this reredos person foremost because well i'm not going to link to it because they deluded it any ways even though the comments were occasionally harsh against them but i don't know why they deleterious been a nice little learning opportunity to be able everything i do because i quoted some of the things they said at the time so i doctor some of it this repository describe their interactions direct quotes include i already hold a grudge against him what i expected from him was to rouse the same button component apply the right props to it and be done when i confronted him i didn't understand his weird choices and lastly in the least experienced death so i thought this was a really interesting post for a number of reasons but also something that i think people do encounter in their teams where we are a code in code convocation ally be ego filled right i've worked with the number of developers who certainly have an ego about their code they think their coat is good they think their coats the best and maybe they don't understand other people's coach choices and sometimes it's easy to get wrapped up in that aspect of things about hay you know i think i'm really good at what i do here you're doing this thing in a completely different way than i would have expected or wanted you to do but you know why does that make me feel so like aggressive toward you or something like that and i think they have really comes down to just some some kind of flaws in the thinking about projects and teams in general so let's start off with talking about the fact that we are a team when you work on a team you have a share go in the easiest way to think about this is sport right near an a sports team you have a shared gold too when the game right to make a touch down tottontail into the top of the mountain to tetraspores i started watching that never looks documentary that you recommended a while ago once i called the fourteen peekin on him i think i am like eight peaks in said donor me but it is the ansar its bananas it is bananas or somebody like me who's like really been into like other climbers like reinhold messer who liked it some watery insane stuff in the sea they doing these these peaks even with oxygen or whatever i'm just like yet this is just straight up and anna's even like an historically its bananas hearsay have these shared goals you have shared opportunities to make wool things in distributed coin away that's going to be helpful for your client it's always important to remember in keeping consideration that just like any other team you have a share gold in that goal is to make the best product or to deliver the best code in the dead lines in time requirements that you have and to keep those shared goals as a keystone in near communication will always help you be a better team mate because your you need to always have in the forefront here that hay we were working together on this thing it's not my coat verse your coat it's not my codrus your code rolls situation here it's alberto can come together in harmony and work together to deliver the product that we need to deliver so your teammates first and foremost are not your adversaries do not hold grudges against your teammates if you have you know beef with your team mates go go go hapanta beef out or something i don't know to go i'm trying to come up with some sort of beef beef joke there but no beast beef figure it out talk about it b people and talk about it no egorger with egos as that something that happens all yetive been on like tewitt for i don't know probably twelve years and like i've seen a lot of these personalities sort of like rye rise and fall where you see people who are getting like it seems to be like the people that a brand new and then as they get better with their still sets and become more popular because of open source libraries are ever there's you see people personality sort of take turns and i've seen many people on montalembert being the person that has a huge ego and fights people on every single decision and will like go up again like you know you had just to libraries that do the same thing and they have two different approaches and that everybody throwing grass at each other which one fastening grass and then at a certain point i often see these people just like sort of like fall off not that they stop weeding or anything but it's just like i don't care any more you know liking and like ivery been in in the same situation as well where you are so invested in something and then when somebody says something against the tackey are not your code and i think that's important thing to remember that if somebody is criticizing your approach your code or or even like the course that you put the there nothing you personally there taking the work that you use made and that he can really hurt but you need to make sure that that doesn't necessarily run your day or or whatever so that's a sort of a long way of just saying like yes i've seen many people over the years and it's it's funny to see the sort of art of people getting more frustrated and more frustrated and then a certain point i feel like as one people i don't know what that point of enlightenment is but at a certain people a certain time someone just goes like i don't care any more if you think i'm just doing my thing here's the thing i have made i here's my ideas i'm open to hear your ideas as well yehafteh you tube has hardened by skin so much but like you know it's so funny because for a long time i would get so and don't know you two comments could run my day but somewhere between this guy has no idea what he's talking about look at the sky stupid face this guy is ridiculously dumb like you know you could so many just idiotic comments like that you started just learn to block out anything like that because it's like you were to take any of these common to her or any of this like ego pushing around it edidit mess you up and so that some point i've like really learned to block out some of that stuff and just like look this person is just either you know they're just either jealous of my success that just haters or whatever you know but either there could just be having a bad day and taking it out on me or honest right so okay let's not hold grudges against our team mates it not be adversaries let's be on the same team let's be working together for shared common goal so let's talk about some practical tips right so one if you're a junior or a more junior developer on a particular project it is your job to listen and provide feedback but not to do so in a way without respect your morsinia developer whose ever leading if you were the lead of this particular thing even if you're not even if you are less in your felisata you're the leontes thing if you are the leader if you are not the lead on this thing so you're following on this thing it is your role to listen to learn to ask questions and to discuss things with respect if somebody says he can you do this thing for me and you are confused about that approach give them a question and say hey imason about this approach here but don't question it saith your reproach stinks will why don't we try my approach what you say he i just like to learn a little bit more about why you you're doing this approach because maybe in my experience i've seen it done this other way then maybe you might learn something right but if you shut them down or you attack someone else as he go you know what happens i don't know meyerbeer relationships in your life and if i come in when i say we you suck like hellespont be like keeroboto be like no uste everybody responds with the russian aggression right it also i think like a lot of people are awful asking questions or saying that's fine like me and my wife always laugh because sometimes i'll be like akatan to do this and shall secure and i sure you know and it's really funny because it's like like a a is this lake are you just been like fine whatever sure or like sure the better to me and like it he can especially now that everybody is on mine you often lose that when you are asked simpson like here this is the i'm building this new thing on remedy not use next yes and like its wondrous excessive thought about that was the like what's the difference in intensive to her to hear about a right in the lock and get lost total wind you are good asking questions yea in the mean beaten cognizant of how your message could be read in different ways as also a big thing is to be a little bit more flowery when possible i mean it doesn't hurt you to be more softer in your prime we got to be charming baby altrove sometimes to cause ganther is going to be grabbed up into it but nature you do understand the guide lines of what they're asking for it as for clarity when you don't get that because if you ask for clarity of front and if you get that information correctly related to you that would you submit your par and they say oh can you do it this other way then you should be may be aware of what they're going to say before they're going to say because like the way this person came across was saying i expected them to do it this way and they did it so kay well didn't they know that they were supposed to do it that way was that relate to them it may be they made these choices for a reason that may be you're not aware of maybe maybe your button component actually sasanian by telling you that they therouenne be they were trying to you know be nicer to you instead of to hurt your feelings in that way either way if you are the lead make sure the the guidelines are very very clear make sure that your your other developers know what they're supposed to be doing don't talk down to somebody if they submit a printer is not your expecting you know get out has a really automotive where you can go line by line and say hey when you did this like three nesters do you mind doing this in an if else because this is may be a little bit hard to read but there are ways to do it it just be nice just be nice be cool if you're doing a creetur your code reviews have the expectation that they are goetter body is aware that we're here to produce good things and then may be not mythic everything like somebody left a comment that says do not do this and then you leave a pier that says he changed the word do not to don't okayondonghsera if you are not belemere you understand what are the guide lines that i think also to greater on the point you said earlier is like you have to remember that like let's say your building a website to help people book realestate appointment you you have to remember that a dandy you're trying to make your client's life easier and make them more money and a love they sing the need to keep those goals in your head and not get so lost in that like everything revolves around you as the developer and you are the keeper of the code and everything like that right like you of course have to make sure that the coat is good and and what not be hot to make sure that your your englishing met as well totally totally tollington tips listen don't pretend to listen really listen like wind you're talking to your pospone about something and or day want you to listen about how their feeling listen don't dump pretend to lay know listen just for real these are people in these are real relationships these year coworkers listen to exactly what they're saying respect your coworkers respect their work respect their code it's something that they put effort into i mean like if i built something by hand like a book shelf and i said in lattitude bookshelf and you come in here you forgot a narrow over there it doesn't help me and be nobody like that that's not happy that doesn't make people happy i don't grudge is about coat there's nothing there's nothing that in the world that i should make you hold a grudge against someone else because of their code if you have beef about it talk about it but there shouldn't even be beef just just really make sure that your aware that you're on the same team with common goals people write code consider the fact that there is a person behind that coat and again if you insult that code he may be insulting that person so don't insult cousteau it right be colander that you are not always right if somebody does something differently than you may be asked why they took that approach before telling them that that approaches wrong try to get inside of their heads face and figure out exactly why they made the decisions they made before trying to cram on their decisions and likewise again be a student and a teacher if somebody is struggling with something teach the to them but don't do it in a condescending way and likewise if somebody is doing something you don't understand ask if they could teach you about how they did it lastly our talk about celebrating winds we as a team we you know you see sports teams they did they do the game they scholasticism doesn't rinderpest i don't know but do outings that everyone would enjoy and really take the time to get to know everybody in a way that you can understand correctly exactly like what would be fun for people or maybe even get managed into a professing or something to say hey if we do this big wind we do this big we all work overnight and and get this thing pushed out the door in time can we do exist this course could leave it this tool can we you know can you buy a alliances to this particular thing or something and who knows maybe i'll get approved maybe it's not mabee's one that you got to know your management and what they can do but either way celebrate those winds in a way that's fun take a break in but one music and have a dance party who knows i've had some teams that have been like that have had all different ways of celebrating winds and there's nothing better than working really hard on something and ganache to take a breather and have everybody you know really celebrate that shared goro so make sure that you are a team you're working together respect celebrate and be cool biliteral good tips unto how to make your team go forward and if anyone else i'd love to hear it like other people's tips make sure you teetotally i do you have any like montresor rules within your team to make sure that this type of stuff doesn't happen iterating that this could really territory totally yeating it's important as like being a manager to be aware of like maybe whose whose bite with who or whose got issues with who in an get ahead of that stuff and may be you can mediate in a way that is you know good for every one all right ah that's it thank you so much for tuning in will catch you on wednesday peatstacknowe to santa outmaneuver

            "resorting to santa bianca with its tastes we toiletries out there strap yourself in and get ready personality and west boss begotten at the pocassett tastes woomeras out there today we've got a really good episode for you on monrepos a whole bunch of the tools that surround running a mono reprobate a motorboat is let her look to a little less sneak bekaise run intreaties or multiple things in one single get refining able to automated starting in updating dependencies all acted stuff they were sponsored by three some companies we got a bran new sponsor to day content by kitchi handles all of your content management we've got log rocket obsession play and fresh books clouting will talk about all the part with through the episode how you doing today mister scotland's k o i am all over the place in west just as one of those nights were like all sorts of things you know happened the dog got to get up in the middle of the night and alsatian you trying to eat your brain moving it's been a roundabout notwithstanding synthetically i have never really died into building a monopoly self until lately i had worked on a couple open source projects the keystone is a huge monolith is popular is like for example i have my life boss monster which is my course platform and inside of that there's there's many things there's the video player which is its own react package that have created and there is also the veneti admit dash board which is next day and then i have the entire serener marketing website for everything and then we have the dash board and there's just a whole bunch of different like pieces and a lot of them are separate applications and in order to have them all on a single greasepaint amongst multiple repos because the capuchon thing an you need to change something in the in another package it's really nice to be able to just have one thing open and dip into all those packages and his publisher new version for everything that you you have touched so to give you another example or sieve similar to yours in that we have essentially several packages that are consumed by both the ape and the user interface so that we have the i which is a solid it we have the pi which is a fast of a piano not sever and we have shared coat holder which doesn't even contain any not bounties just shared code between the server and the client or any packages you might as histiophorus in botany stuff that auction or managing things that we used all the time for both some of our environment stuff then i also have created a handful of open source packages for spells i have a side menemen query package i modified a forked one of the details packages to have it work with a kitten suicide rendering and spell to which is my thing or modifying global state release and then i have an avenue project which is a recital destitute that's our old interface but i still use some of the advances on it so i keep it around just while imparting some of that stuff over stone have other packages i have been at for package and the way which is their grappling that i made and so were using this not only to share code between but we have some several boompjes in then we have some open source libraries that are actually since our main manorial is a private repose those nested shared open source packages all being brought in vessels get sophocles which is where you have another get rebound of reference in set of reponam people seem to hate that technique but me personally it's been working out just fine thanks so eating like that makes sense i think because like you want those to be open source right you want those to be readily available on an get havenith's a case then if it's not an honest open source or a hundred cent close soriso where in between them you have to do something like that right right and that's the toughest part when i was looking for unaroused not like a use case that comes up that often where you like or in one the main thing to be private but some of them to be some of them to be a public so how would you do that and there's not a lot of good ways of fixing public and private repose with a manifesting other than by using so much so if anybody has like the most ideal floor that hit me out but i do think the somals one is working really well for that fresh the moderate as been really handy because previously what i had done for some of my work lonesomelike let's say i was at the big one for me as my slim i working on my course platform and i find there something different in my eleusinian like linked to your local version so that you can work on your local version at the same time or you can do it you can just fix it publish a new version and then odaenathus not a very good work closely were like for example in keystone as entire seems every single one of their not every single one but a lot of their like fields a image up load field or a date pickerel all these can be their own package and electrical as say you have to change something across eleven different packages that's a big pain to do so in metrical just have folders you look a package is older and you can make those changes and in real time you can see what they're what they look like and then when you're ready you can run a scrip at old publish all of them to to nor you nobly ye mean that's the best way to describe it so in reality like you kind of been saying that a motorist have multiple packages in one reboant be able to manage those orchestrate them and they are yet but specifically for the reasons that we've come for it talked about here where your sharing code across packages they think can become really helpful with larger teams because argerment make all of their coat available but at the same time keep it all all separated in a controlled manner where years sinigang packages yearlin of reference throughout the project but again its keeping everything sort of separate in overall just organization orchestration right automation trying to install things across many packages trying to update versions try to keep things connected trying to run one thing that relies on another thing that might rely on another thing all of those and of work flows are benefited from monrepos speretual deering on a single project that they create react aside or something a man recount going to be a great idea but if you're working in a team or a year don open source work or you have a lot of packages available or you just like living up your coat into a lot of smaller packages a smaller entirely different projects essentially than then amoretti that makes more sense to you and i've heard that like face book and dolabella single replied they've had to make their own version control system or forget or most one that everybody used to forget that were pressed subversion i don't know what they're on the says it became interesting to talk to somebody who reggerlations if you need to like mica change to bugle dog and what does that look like i would like to know what how how that man rebels to use i mean i'm sure not terrible because you know it he's by such a large organization or they wouldn't do it that way but yester interesting topic to me and specifically now that i've done a little bit more with monrepos i definitely understand the appeal even though i'm only on a small team of people on a giant in a like i i've heard people talk about forever i am still pretty new to this i think the scottsboro what a couple of weeks and you've used years for how long have you had a moneylending um you know it's been a long time it's been a long time but my current iteration of it the penmarks based as one has only been there four months so really not that long but this to me feels most classic leonore of anything i've done that before i was unknowingly kind of writing my own orchestration monoplane too is out of a note grandemont reinventing the wheel here somebody are edentates all let's get into that then so with the modern be used across like a coating language but obviously where were obscener and were using an porredda's called anaesthesia two yards of narrative the way that it works is that in your fourteenth insect you define where all of your packages actually are so memento i tried for bikaneer to get mine to work and i kept getting the third of the hairy thing is is is that dependencies are really complicated because you've got your main package jason often you have stuff that is shared in that main package jason and then you'll have like like you have to ling in your main packages and i specifically have my toiling in my life yes linde in my main packages on is that where you put yours as well yeah yeah although one at some point i think style and has stopped working for me since moving to this man report any digue that out but yet i do i do and sometimes when you create new projects it's like creating other palikare new spelling too want to create a new pretty erchie and new all these slanders files i have to always remember that i read have dealt one i don't need to keep creating these if intestine shift to you that that's your main one and then you have like a package of older or something folder and in that folder you have another fold of for every single one of your other many repose what do you have in all that obviously a motorboat and in each of your items in your work space are in that folder and mellor spaces it was working for me for a while and then i just started getting into the schleischer like if he pantaleone re then it also installs in all of the child works may as well and tries to use plink behind the scenes to link towards each other and it just was such a pain in the but i had a people for braintop me and finally just gave up on said scott always talking about police it's let me try it and i just made a work space file pick two seconds boom worked flawlessly has been for a week and a half so that is why people emerel about papa was conscious that he is whitest works i only switched to pencastle the works spaces on boarding went i know that at the time emphasis gotten to work spaces yarn and had work bases for a little bed but the pinpointed a little bit more effortless than terms of the works bassvilliana of that union to set up just a way smaller and witless work sometimes i pick things based on how much work it will require me to do as statistics before this look like all right disconsolate lines i guess this is the one ridiculous i was really enjoying that i had her set the whole thing up for importances and moving over to camp was just creating one more file with literally three lines in it and i was like this is great that we have is somewhat of a standard in that i don't have to like change the code in any way it was just a little bit of continent specifically the problem that was i know people are going to be a goose issue of ten pm because like i know people don't like impious yarn reverend i've always been like i just want to stick with them p m like yet my courses intimidate whole yarn changing on me and then my course or out as yasi always tried to make it work with them pim but there was like the lake you know the frustrating error cannot find package whatever and it's not been installed in like i frenetico it's anoder it's in the folder and finally i remains up in the air and moved over pitman it's been great and it also does you that this before but it also puts like like lethaean like react or low dash it puts it triestino computer so that if you use react in like fifteen projects it only tells of one say don't have forty gigs of no models which is an excellent idea yet it's a great you know i actually went to the empire after after that the dreaded like you of multiple versions of graft you all in your project i state are they and the year like a intenseness just trying to find this thing like me an yer yea the fricken phagocyte is amazing in that like literally everything you can install and you can this is wholly gossau but also like when it doesn't work man it's beautiful but it's also a train wreck at the same time yet i ought to about yarn really quickly yarn one work spaces is what a lot of people are telling me to use an two i guess also has them it doesn't seem like a whole lot of people have moved to that i just have i did not get into a all so it's probably were checking that out eager for me without it was five minutes of work so i was really happy teahouse on for maybe a little bit when i first came out but then on the peashooter ance improvements and then there were the works facetious enticing but he had not that misbeliever similar and hard to choose one for me you know is also easy decision is checking out one of our new sponsors today is content by and to go west you want to talk about content i can too yes we got a sponsor content with a c by capacite headless a mass which is pretty cool they have live editing so you're nontechnical users can use it and they have life the developer what do you care about that while they got a rest a pi a grateful api if you want to use that they have all kinds of tools that make it really easy to work with job scripter language that you possibly will want they have lots of good immigrations with next asteropaeus till integrate with it they have lived editing for james stock in other apswith's really really cool it's just really sweet so you want to check it out for your next project go to content day content do i forsitan that gives you an extended free trial normal for trial is one month this is going to give you the remonstrating you content by canto for sponsoring by cantagalli let's move into osachile bit about it though the process of working with you have a package at jason and your fate all these known montesano you do with them what the process for managing all of these different libraries caswell using thousands of libraries in every project so yerly what it comes down to it each of your packages and of having their own package that jason and energies their own packages and central their own versions of this but you can manage the install process across all of those from the report even i don't i'm going to be speaking a little bit just straight from how i'm in it imposes a son a lot of these tools were going to mitigate on have their own ways of doing these things their own way working in your reproof me i able to remove every note module where a pinecone just remove all the nomads than i can do pantasote root and it's going to reinstalment of every single package that i have is then going to get their packages installed and those are all going to be shared a cross that that route repeaters of persians and doggoned vasilisa for me personally it is pretty easy to quickly install and manage alfred's across anything just with a simple pantomimed from any given individual project a absolutely love that because with pipenta lot of my time to leaving no models and deleting the package of locating a reentering will work after that and that pentland is great and thistle single one of your dependence folders so i don't know if we may discern but every single one of your works spaces has its own package ajai meaning that like my video player will have any like the vimont that but then my aphasia of express you know like they all have their own dependence and then when you run amphitrite route it will walk through each of those and install everything that is needed between altamont let's suck about i unintelligent each of yarn and pimp have their own way to install an unusally all have flags where you can install something in a specific work space or what i found easier is just into the actual directory and in running peppmuller pimental the one issue i have is that i can't get past running and run de instead of pimp defend there's a couple of people at script that will override that and check which one you're in and i have a implemented any of those just yet but there are there are solutions for that table to it by now i justifies normal to me it's in find myself doing temper every like projects that aren't like the opposite problem of that where i'm in easing he interjects that don't use and behoof so we talked a little bit about that you would do this to reference and arcot like how exactly do you do that now again this is speaking from a pint perspective but a pniese tive amelioration gouyou know the way that we do it is that you have your dependency your normal dependency in your package that jason but when you install a package but say i have a package named at leveled halo and i do hempenstall at lavalette inside of this manor and another package what is actually going to do is look instead of my own work space and see if that package exists and if it does it's going to essentially just similarly to that folder and the package that jason will be prefixed with the word work space in our dependency lines so it will say loveletters and then for the version number till say work space colonna than the version of her and that's how you know that it's actually looking inside of your work space for that package no more having to deal with and him link let me tell you and families got to be one of the most mysteriously like i have no idea and pleaver works when i run in on like i don't know it i can't tell where atomistic visual i can pass to the repose i know that if i make a change to the work space ile that is automatically going to be available to me in whatever project in currently working on so to keep this going on with the panting again this is my experience nais that by default you are often running commands from the root like i said like tenpins as going to install things for every work space every package in your works face where if you want to run from one thing you have a couple of options di'mond ring what do these you primarily do us but you can set into your package like daces you will and then do the anticipator you can use the filter command from or the filter flag i should say from the root to pinpoint this thing i and hyphenated the package and that you want a reference so if i want to install one thing too only at lovelace i would use it in in filter elliott say okay only install this or only do this task to this one reply filtering that way and then what i've done from there as i created a ton of script inside of that rubaconte has the filter already baked in so what's a if i just want to run the wideopen i'm running just poulain what that does is that runs with no script that just as pepinster and level up to fort last outwater the package came thou can use that you i call in the front of the dam command and that will ye have the run the coon is is just a formality like you don't all okay yeah there's nothing materialist like how they did it so that i tetaheite i've been using terreforte but i'm i'm curious if that's there some of those some of these tools overlap responsibilities tonometric one i should be using for what at so i i was just that i've been acting into the directory mostly because i can't remember what the thing tientietnikov because it is different for i think it's dash or dashed at or duchesses or something like that and now it's oh i see i see what you're doing here so we'll put an example in the notes here i was on misunderstanding what's got was so is he just makes his own scriptures things locman you say it on the audiophone couldn't i can't find a great answer to my life five minutes of googly for this so if you have like let's see you have two packages that both need for act or both needs felt what do you do do you install the dependency of spelled in both of those packages or what have also heard is people just have a third or another package that simply just imports the share dependencies and then immediately export it which seems the bit odd to me that seems to be an tomtoddies dodoothat seems a little intense to me that in taiohae an updated to spell then you just have to make sure that you are updating spelt in multiple packages and making sure that you're on the same reversion for each of us you how i do it i mean beside yet doing it visually i'll post the command and here a basically so pampas their own like visual update so i have in my repast haven update script so the sueciae update sittin update and what that runs is pep repulsive up thine i think capital litany which will give you the latest and versions of olimali the packages in a visual way where i can say i saw this one install this one in stationer all of my repose so that way i can do all of the spell updates at once make them all the same version it entertainers the back of beautiful yeah i can i can see see that like both of those are a kind a tricky beast you do need to put a little bit of remembering it i think that's better than having to like literally what some people would do as they would have like a shared package young in that share package they would install react and then they would import react and then just export it right away in that file and then then you have to like import react from shared and then like this probably a pain in the but for types and all that so i think i like that that version that you have much better yet all seems like all seems like a lot and maybe that's why there's tools that exist to you know help with this yeabsly we have actually your by listening to it the show on monday was about updating some glad that we talked about this now because we are about to record after this a show on just how you up at your projects when there's lots of dependencies and maintenance of them does well if you're managing many different versions of different libraries you're bound to make mistakes somewhere because watteaus intense and he could release lady to have some bugs in your application and then you might like a sponsor to help you solve one of these buds in fact i shed a bug to day this is a just chatting with a waddy said this is the good fiestas for ligonier because laroche definitely would have come into play had i not gotten eight hundred emails about it this morning i pushed it up did to the site and updated the fellers which removed at a breaking a change and therefore i pushed a breaking epi change with for some reason not now finding it i don't know how i didn't find it before when life but seriously within twenty four hours i had a billion people trying to resent their password all at the same time on the sight for some reason and all of those people had trouble with that so because of that it would have grown in heinecken in their unsure if i lugged in to my log racket right now i would have seen various session ary place as right a video replay of someone trying to go to the password reset page and seeing the exact error that i have seen already and that error caused by an apache has caused my sight to break so if you would like to have visibility as actual ideo scribble session ry play with counsel logs network requests all that an more you'll want to check out boocket is really truly an excellent service law racket do come forward last santa in illgotten days for free nearly able to see the rameses see the bugs and hopefully not have to get a bunch of emails from people who had intestate great tricolored comprehension for wallace for a sponsor all right let's talk about some of these tools that are also handy with monrepos because what ends of happening is that like let's say you want to run and cameronian that will start up your grace that will start parcel to you watch you see assessor any changes you want to bundle you your job escript and you got a whole lot going on there and sometimes would happen is that you put up several taps in your european and you run and prudden in a couple of these there are some tools out there and that's not all they do but there is the sort of this growing area of tools that will make this much easier for you partholan lately that we've heard a lot about iturbide and was recently acquired by versaliis pretty cool so well taboureau is kind of in the same area as well so let's just talk about what turbinates right now it seems that they have a couple of things up their sleeve in terms of what else it will do but it's an i call it an orchestra or a build pipeline so if you want a run prudders need to run and pernille what tends to happen is a lot of people just string together these and as in a empurple run this then run this and then run this and if you want to do two things at once then you have to lie in salicornia and its skin of kind of pain in the but right i know yes that's the first thing that torpedoes is it's sort of a build pipeline meaning that you can just run and run and i'll run turbare run of and then you in your taboring you will define what needs to happen in which order and that's that really really nice and say i am going to run and pam start but namtar relies on running and pimoni on three of these things first and you you can imagine those get much more complicated with database and and environmental variables and all that good stuff so that has been really really nice for me to use a beaver happy with them i have checked this out at all yet i haven't i have questioned so for you i mean like the biggest question i have with these tools is that there they are built build ye bind to a man it's just it's just running your your scripts inside of your folders right it's not like because what i saw about anais that it's it's a bill tool in that like to build a stellionatus lugano an but turrets more along the lines of like how works bases work in that its reverencing our own scripts in your own packages is that correct yet okamoto knowing it works with yarnin knows about your your work spaces kasi you want to run and pimentade in all of your work spaces it will know to go and then i really cool thing about it as they will also consolidate the aid the output so if you want to see a conform your your back and and you are see any bulldogs from your front end it's all in one terminal which is good and bad but it's nice not have to go hunting for that stuff if you've got multiple things running in most projects adamana a front and a back and and you have to run to tabs which is not not the end of the world but it does get more complicated once you get past that right yet so so that's what i mean that's how i do it within paintwork paces as well so i guess like what's the added benefit there is that the the cachalot is the added benefit over easing to straight up work spaces yes so that's something i don't know i don't know in terms of the orchestration because i just went straight for this so pimples run your let's say you have death command in your ear from it in your back in campamento those for you at the same time a yahoo but i don't think you have been i don't think you necessarily have maybe they control over where you could say this one relies on this one or anything like it i'll writing pinehurst then it's going to run penpont packages in my my reboso this one you get a little bit more control over that all you can also do parallel bills so let's say you want to build your c an you an a bully jovian you want to compress images a lot of times those things loiterer and one of the biggest frustrations doing builds and deploying the thing is that like i don't want to have to stay here for eight minutes while my website bulbs i just wanted to play this thing especially peopling from the old fashioned adolphine sister benefit that it hasn't i talk to jane's going to come on parasital about the stuff better than better than we know but it can do increment build so loyal that same line just what interrupt if you have questions for jared sense and the more way that way we can make sure that we ask all of the questions that you might have about this as well because i'm interested in knowing what other people are wondering as well so terrorising of your bill so it knows what are the input to your belt and i knows what the output to your build are and because it knows in and out its smart about washing your content and cashing those things so i says i will you change your case i'm not going to frankenhoehe yours because we already did that last time i have it already have it and i don't know how that works obviously there's something with its smart about washing your content but because it knows about that and like i put my my parcel in there and i had an extinction in there and a bunch of sesostris that was compiled in there and because it knows about that stuff it can just inclemently build the only the parts that had changed like let's say my biggest pepeeta like i launched something in there's mistake and i start getting ten thousand emails about it i want to quickly change that but eight minutes to build the sight in the long time when these people sending you tweets about your broken susette it so you could just be like only got just play none yet commit a blast it up and it will all be smart about it and i could gebiete thing much faster than doing an entire eight minute bells right like that that's really important to me as another benefit that you get with this cashing is that it can do cloud cashing which is this is not sinfire but i know that some website especially website that have huge bill times they can get into thirty forty minutes of bill times and if somebody does a bill on their computer or on like a continuous integration apparently you can share those caches amongst your entire team will just down the cash i don't know if somebody done some bully resource intensive task in your repointing ay or a video compression or something like that or maybe it may it took an image and made four hundred thumb nails base of that image right then some one already did that process intenser than you could share that cash amongst everybody else in your team and i bet this is why for so bottomlands for salathiel cassander that you pay monthly for because it improves the speed of your er actual not not only your build but your daftie as well and i don't know anything at biotanates why these companies do these things ye tawniness potations that is your thoughts but yet they lasting i have here a doesn't handle your dependency tree so like i was tweeting about my amphoras not working in irons like you tobermorie love when i talk like that against outbreathed the like and cannot find this dependency torpoint help you there yet that's what that's what jarados maybe there are also going to they'll be a fourth player in this arena where you can harborpoint something i don't know but that would pretty sweet simpaticone tegetmeier another tool that does i would say the same thing which is anaxarchus anecdotes sillily had ignored this for so long because i thought it was angular you know and attention like inglorious and year but then there's a actionists not angular they did the same thing as well so they have some very good i think torres built in russ and am pretty sure annexes built in go there both very fast and i saw there are some twitter spat on whose faster which is like i don't care the like they all have grass where they treat compare each others and they like you know you know when when any everytime i repeat like shows a graph of howpaslet five thousand in faster than the other tools like a right yes i natisone is also worth checking out it seems that it's been around for a while they are very they have like a bunch of tools the ennui dependency graft tools around it which seems pretty cool intent one out as well as i did so i had you know the pentamerone from an undue just to get a balanced procreates like it's doing way more like were tarborough there all running your own command seems like an ax itself is taking over the task of being the built too so i says i the fact is fast extend sensible bill system the next generation filled system with first class monrepos support in powerful integration from my understanding this thing is doing the bullones that you were running a speech you would need a special spelt and exploit the fellside in that to me is a little scary because you know that's not like if this is not taking overparticular build is but it just knows the important output unflushing that it is but you know an expose teetering totally wrong here and we will retreat let me let me read it here because i very distinctly remember this being built system i mean it says that the build system but ye will have somebody on this is the one thing about having gasps i don't ever one alike have a gasp from like one of these things because then the other people like well what about us you know eaveshoots of monrepos building and big team big works spaces yeatman the discontent is doing more need like a special began build any aticular thing so like i wonder how it plays well with all of these different things as this says if you'd like to compile felt with an extended bluenoses on the explains many organizations use an ax without any plug an if you are mainly interested in making your works face faster or nablin distributed tax task execution of that seems to be another thing that they do a lot distributed task execution made that means like cloud computing based for each of your task than weapons aren't necessary okay that yet it does seem like there's a lot of things in her what there that is the dependency graph which looks great the all of them are doing like cashing or at least many of the better ones are doing cashing easy shared cohering ownership management mark rebuild also a lot of editor pluggin dead generators powerful code generation interactive visualizations works with get hub and get a actions so ye pluggin everything wonder what these plugs are doing essentially the really interesting to divinest plug in here and the tides build dead server and packages but time in but like does it did they buy right their own or are they using their probably i know that we could probably know this for the potassae world in that like deposite being totally written like a year ago were all used in babyland wet pack and now it's just like we've got all these new tools it's unreal yet in a year feeling lukoper by this you don't have to know all of these tools for saddening ones you can't use all of them in one project and i don't recommend you doing that or anything just cause i mean again the lot of these things are kind of hard hearing the same kind of responsibility so you really probably should get good at one of them but it is interesting that this one has such a giant community and the giant amount of packages and extensions for it so i opobalsamum diving diving harder into an xmas at alora usually when a service a daftlike this looks good he doled the you i have it all looks nice he usually means that they've cracksmen they have a lot of eerste have money to spend on those types of things they have an ex cloud like they have like a paid path already so like the right this is pretty polished right if you compare the nex do dat learns website is like you can tell they're not the same class of toolroom and then we'll be able to talk about them oh yeah lemonte again write everything i learn our last sponsors which is for us fresh maxima for non accountants you its intuitive easily as accounting and invoices that does it all from sending and following up on invocatory capturing receipt for expenses you get paid twice as fast with fresh books which is really really cool one little thing that i did recently in my fresh books was you can add your accountant on to your fresh books for free booleywag intestine and need all your receipts and ailie not even received falseness for for twenty twenty one and i was all right but i used to say ah i just exported them all but i was like well though betimes boohoo as i was able to just give him access directly which is awesome to chickeraboo doom for flash contacted no critic card requires thank you fresh books for sponsoring sick cool okay let's keep it moving here there's a couple more that we wanted to talk about learns one that's very very highly used in for me the spelliker basis in some way work it's not really doing the hauch in terms of its giving us some orchestration tools is giving us some organization tools but it's not trying to take over more of bill process is not doing like wild a distributed task execution stuff it's not analyzing your words pass it's not really doing a tone but it is making it easier to manage multiple packages within one manorites some time with the learner dockside using lernen chose to do panamas and my general thought was just like i not use words pass it feels to meet the fellies wasn't doing that much more than work spaces was heatherstones of like it's like all hashishin than learn or as i did the same thing and the answer is kind of but it also does more but also not as all of it and to check that out i had never needed to get in to learn i know that it's a bit difficult to get set up but again it's another thing that's worth checking out by you doing this montreuil of people use learn a but i also feel like learn i was probably the catalyst for tools like harborpoint is yet the just wasn't as good as those tools some prior art ah what else is our rush as a lot of people recommended that one to me it seems like a dosing teams as pampur check this one out at all i also considered i also considered this an i'm sorry from microsoft brush folks but that those done do documentation for this was really pretty rough you know it's like you go into like getting started and like one of the first things in the getting started is don't do this and herefords that you need to know like do not do not do this and like you should consider deleting these files and doing the oliday it doesn't feel exactly like a smooth experience in terms of wakening i found the docks to be extremely daunting for some one like me if you poopen there like eight hundred pages in the docks and filled with all sorts of caveats and who knows what some tifel like in the again another learner it's not trying to be an accident rintherout felt like a more like a management tool or large teams and i'm sure i'm sure i'm getting any of these things at the new one here some degree wrong but when i was looking at a rush it didn't give me the warm fuzziness using it gave me a little bit of red flag like okata a youthful tool if you know what you're doing with it but as somebody who just wants to get up and running with something it itemised i think a lot of it was built toffdom or inspired by learner and a just wondering like what they say serpint uses it when do store use it so like heelmarks right a lot of jobs script and they probably have some rubiginosa i was thinking that maybe viscosity i don't see any looks like this cousselain iii have this one recommended me as well so rushed if there's a something that like makes rushes nooks the thing that makes rush special because when i look at the ducks it does seem to me to do the same things that all of the other winds do it allows you to easily link packages or even again like work paces right install things cash things of things up and running faster make sure you're not sending duplicate versions they have oopathi about and poplars were like the same same library being loaded multiple hineline that but what is the secret saucer because definitely does not make it obvious what the secret saucepan is like a costly unrelated but have his coat seemed to still be using gulp to bundle everything interesting outbeaming i wonder how many pompeo still download gulaek i better the lot one point five million year mimi gulf video shtories you atone watches still in the brown superimposed by the ex that's like strides those athos thirteen or two thousand and fourteen i probably pollyanna major clubs the idea too that five ileliobas wet pack as about tonillo download a week and golampore not an inclusive close okay well all that is information not personally i recommend starting with work pass and whether it amphoras or ganapati or whatever the work pace for me felt like minoret enough where i'm on a small team i'm not on a massive team here in for me it gave me all the tools that i need to manage my things but i'm also interested in some of these larger ones especially arboreous you know are garden miss he you know pretty pretty altimeter thing so yeah i give that a try i want i give an exam time too maybe i'll i'll sit down and not right my good platform and i but maybe just try to implement it in some degree yea far as i understand it just sits on top of your works basso you should be able to integrate it at least taboret an ax but is worth a curious to hear her what you think about it please do let's move into some sick pictish section of the show where we pick things that are sick and i am going to sectioning that scott sidetable go as my wife and i recently went down the rabbit hole of getting a new vacuum and while back got had sick picketing tenchester down the rathlin the research on the stick back human is it even good enough to replace your plugging one and all that in we landed on the tiny coat eleven it's not i don't think it's the same one that you do but yours has like the licentiate same motor in it and it is awesome cemeteries as a dog all these little attachments for like cleaning the crevices of the couch and everything right that an i very very impressed a howdacious is and it's great wealth the charger on the wall and then he platin and when you do it it just charges the battery and then it has a spot on the top for a secondary matter it because that's the thing with these coreless is a battery to run out a onsartainty minutes or so which is long enough to do like a spot in the grain battery don't twenty minutes but man it's been awesome the tiny cot alain like is that it looks like an apple product from like the nineties your says minions like a electrometer years is really nice mine is like the sage green color but he also lot of clear pestilential awful but it's great i aischa the dice and for a long time before that the dacentest stick once and it was fine but the battery was kind of a prominent you have to charge at a plug it in outang in on the thing but with the neckties to me is it like i don't need that my phone but hospitable battery in the backing generative you the old tool eating i love to inenew battery and there especially with you you know hernando don't want to be stomachache robot becometh about that yet his name is low max named after a bernelow from weakened at bernieres sweet name kasim gottesacker camera of the third generation wise camera as they are normally is very cheap for what it is it's a little usharshid bucks for the betheniville indoors or outdoors is like water safe like so you can put it out doors without having to have a special case on it but i think really one of the coolest things for me was like that the colored night vision is wild i mean the quality of a rangatira i have to i was a hedonist up in the kitchen and i was just looking at it on my phone and as like i left the kitchen lights on and then i went downstairs and i catilina so musotte crappy microcards because when you get these wise cameras you can pay for their subscription or you can just pop a little at my creditor as well and a fine pack i pack of thirty two gibberts from amazon is twenty two dollars and it's unreal and is ogden going to be highest quality in the the very well may break at some point but it's five microseconds for twenty two dollars sunnyasi six of these at the cottage and i had two of them crapeau your writing to the thing twenty four hours a day it's recording constantly and what's the solution is bicolor bobino in entering so yet you're generating some some waste there but you can recycled them you have electronics recycling actually i don't know you do for electronics recycling but we just keep a large bin like when most clear pet plastic bands we just keep on in the garage in a time need to recycled electrons we just toss it in there and then when the bengali a drive over the best by and dump that thing in the electronics recycling benedetta with electronics as well as like batteries are local like lilias facility as a special spot for batteries to bring all of our old batteries there big man of all the wise cancelling to get the wise flood light camera eating i have the what's the temanite rinehart ring door bells and a ring flood like caminar garbage boofima broken and been replaced and now the flood like cameristus on onfredo when there's no motion at all so i am over the ring statehouse have been setting my ring in their outside of likonga athletes reenan adra yea you can draw like an area and its still triggered area it still trickery willie the area weren't you look in the materia don't even look anywhere else yet we have we have that was oronooco is like where on a bit of a hill and like i drawled not do not go in this area and any time somebody walks in the area it still triggers it and it must be that it's like on like an edge or something like that but over it and it's expensive to have there's no sicardot i'm hoping to get the unity or bolas i have the the unified what wisdom hochelaga because i have the unity like rack mourner and there's a tout a hard drive in it and i have all these unify cameras and like one of the cameras you can get as a door bell and the it's the best like i have tons of wise stuff and i've tonantis and they're not in the same league because the unfortified five tons of workmens fibroid cameras are unreal shameless bosom for such courses as elissa the training courses that i have he can check it out used copingstone bucks off i'm going to shamelessly plug level up the tories at calm you can said become a level up row to day and you will save twenty five per cent of rangering or ratoon in i think artressi you want to get in to day you can look in on their radfoot you cancel or whatever we're going to have new courses from a sort of really talented concentrates but addition we currently have courses from people like obedience so much for listening and we will see you on monday tostatus in your boast player or drapery if you like this show\n",

cottons has followed me but if i'm not in the apt then i should or like doin a push in it a patient if i already seen that so magic bell as they since smart notifications which if they've seen it at in one part then it's not going to notify you about it in the other the other parts which is a super super smartly batch task you can have preferences that this is one of those things that like you think it's so simple to just add a notification little little bell to your your application but then you get into all of these little educates and all like somebody wants a notification will once a day or i want to if i seen it in the pan don't ye maltese very very complicated so he need notifications in your attentat magic bell dotcom the free plan gives you a hundred now you maisonrouge active users that that's what that means that you can't a hundred of those for free and if he used the coupon centaure going to get temperment off for your first twelve months thank you metabolisms ring nice cool let's get into abiding a project dependencies we all looked at adesso wherever those of you who don't work at one in job ascripti maybe your new developer our projects are lion other packages to work right with your writing and react package or react website didn't react is going to be one of those packages we call those dependencies we depend on them because they are the packages that were using in their application so that's what a dependency is and less they could anastasia of the year with a new gumption for life and i decided i am going to update everything so i use that tacebit was on gatton niobe agency for personal website was unanswered needed omitted again be for my course platform had a whole bunch of dependency updates and updated sat needed to happen this intact website was on next yes ten as well as a whole bunch of other things and thus updated to next year twelve so this updated form like fairly large web sites and i have put together a sort a process for for going through the insane joked in the past and half joke and half real just yellow updating some of your stuff which means that you just literally updated all and to some hope for the best and you can you can do that and to a certain point but when you come back to a project you haven't touched and six or eight months there often is major versions that have been updated in the fifteen twenty things that are all new version so like what is your process for even approaching that so i put together some steps as to what i think is a sane way to approach the something in a curious to see how how scott does that as well this is morgan to be on like like tools or not or not tools but like more of methodology is tendin the past we've talked about an actual project called pm check up dates and you and that's specificate are any updates and if you're using a monoplane you can do as ashleep and it will go through every package jason i tell you what updates are in there and then you just told me that there is something built into pinafores wellhausen pup is the command and if you pass at the open eye lower case i flag it will give you an interactive version which is to liken those lists were you can hit space bar to philinte dot and choose which one you want opatas their night ianito ell it will give you all latest versions of packages rather than just like i think patronising in unneat sure i always use the eldest because i like to see what the newest stuff is unified not going to update to it but i love these interactive tools whether it is the aversion of this thing he inversion oriental of them are just this is the way i do it here as another trade which would be like the pagans for his code that will tell you if there's a new version in your package that jason and you can do it be a package that jason it seems like a little porteous to me but if you're the type of person who likes to work in that kind of environment rather than running a person like you can have a good guess like a viable option as well so theosophist thing i do when i did these dissolute and you ileuge list of everything and all tell you what needs to be dated and aversions are there and will usually color them green or red or elinor yellow and those are associated with somber asthmatic visioning and that those software in somber that's what no jesus uses or puss is a three point system so one point three point one and which had isobel quickly the the first point if you're going from one point whatever to two point whatever that the major version meaning that there's likely going to be breaking changes in that and then if you're going from twettenham update and that should not have any breaking changes but it can have new functionally or at least backwards compatible functional maybe they've changed how lived on something but the epi should still work or they're not going to take away a method that you're using in a minor update and then there is a patch release so two point two point one oshondonto pointer some broke and there's a bug in the lycee case so we patched it and it doesn't change any intentional actually work and that's how most people should follow it is definitely not always the case but in most cases if you get one of those patch up dates all up dat all those first like one there's a new low dash unique of three point five point two i'll just update that as pristine you know then i'll go through all of the minor of dates as well and then i leave the major ones for athabasca the same thing i do i do the exact same thing athirst minoret yet beautiful then i'll go through and upgrade groups minor groups at the same time so i won't update everything every single thing at once that is a minor updated groups at a time so interesting at b and all of its gas be plug ins all do it you can do a dasher on your ands and you can update anything that has gastein the word in that walkill the dependencies island and all of the slapped all those at once if there oh minor and then finally one time done that i'll go through any any other minor stuff that he hasn't been updated number three is update major dependency so these are things that have done a full version bombarding into a something might break her history things as be three to four was a big one is linesmen or seven to eight a major version of babble major version of of react you can kind of that if you are doing a full version bump that something might break or a lot of places like react they will deprecate but not remove functionally in a major version and then the next major organ they were removed it so if it let's say you react one of its remove used the fact were on reactionaries but it would start through warning say he pretty soon this is going to be removed there not there not rodigast but that's just an example and then in recent they would totally remove it once every one's had enough time and use you get least like a year two years to catch up to those things before you actually have to do up grading and actually change how your good works yea in an honestly depends like what the report because i do know that like some things are more likely to break another for instance like mongooses like a pretty mature package if if you going from a major version to another major version you can probably guess there will be breaking changes there especially because its somberness know that a major update is for breaking changes but like if you have like es line or something i have no problem yellowing a full version of that of the lancashire low stakes right so i do like to calculate the stakes and also if there is like a high stake on before i before i make any sort of change or modification to those packages i will go straight up to their changed logs and look in the release the section releases the erosive never deereeree go to any reports just right there on the just under the about there's a releases a lot of packages will say here's the reliefs in the typically have a changed log or at least at least in ability to look at some of the prose what exactly when in there and so majorian checking out that first esactly what i did say monotone that i just upgrade on friday myself they went from a major version to another major version and behaving in rehabilitating that's running on the server so i needed to update among goose so that it worked with the neversink prepared myself for that upgrade that's coming in a couple of weeks but torrence and they will almost always have a bulleted list of usually up to apis that nobody ever uses and you go through each of those bullet points and you can almost always just search in your your corrector or not in your good base and say did i use this did i use this did i use this and then when you hit something that you did use it will say we don't all anger you as if you need to use this like furnace i was using a mongoose using dootin they change that to either destinate entries or do count entries on and there was a little bit of like if he needs to filter based on non index fields used the one otherwise use this one sees got a kind of read through it up to your coat base make sure a still works and then you got to go i'm aim doing this i will be doing get committed for every lie of great gate agramonte upgrade selingman that allows you to sort of catch these updates soldatin i wrong you can always roll back that specific changes yet i always created a new branch for updating of those those runs but oh this is another area i do anastatius grip an releasement because if they were already major apaches in everything is fully types types gonella you it's going to be a often longer method or whatever that error and that being now ye are you you you passing a string here it's no longer supported to pass a string you have to pass an object with a value propensity of his unwarlike that you know that's another huge auge benefit for typescript solemnly after that once have done all those major dependencies all up grade any stand alone stuff is to do some research on like for example i had updated database version so this is not a dependency but it's that what's actually running up my database side you sometimes need to regenerate a lot of times i know i know striped as this i know sandy does this lot of really good companies will version there pistacia with pikes so if you are upgrading to a new version of a package sometimes you'll have to reach it and new sadako that as well to go along with it and you need to make sure that your updating those they pikes at the same time that you're running a bill or wherever its being used what else test assiout test for your potatoes run those those are save your bacon you because you can automatically catch those things if not run the thing lickrod make sure everything is good like scott as you have to like now like is this major or minor and my aptitudes or my cuckoo those are major for me or am i updating it debtor like a tiny little format money function where sombre but it's not the end of the world right so to erfurt to know if these are major or minor watch your error logging as specifically i have century in a front and and my back and and i will just kinda have it open and sometimes something will break in houses in your century and you know you can say i am very clear to me that and that was that was the chupatties immutable house is that you can just roll back to a working version of you don't have to necessarily roll back i get commit you can just fix forward i think is the word that a lot of people do they said don't roll back explored and even better you if you have typesetting the bill on your young gould it you can run types good first they have other outline lasting i have as is just pray this canoes back to the yellow update is just hope that everything he goes causeth one thing about using all seas dependencies in no gas world is that you don't always know what has changed under the unless you read every single line of code down the fifty dependency tree lines half to know there was an issue the other day were unpopular open source maintainer just cut a need his packages and broke a lot of stuff but luckily those were major version updates and anybody who you'll updated and didn't check what happened her version updating a major major no jazz project hopefully those are helpfully thing aloud their scott no it's funny we have been we cannot independently came up with the exact same general work low for these things without unsolicited both in ireland doing all the same things you do in that i think that's a good sign that what we're doing is both practical and reasonable so totally yell right well thanks for cheating you at you all one day be painter to santa doubtfully of valour shoes and don't forget to subscribe in your bobcat player or drop a rebel if you like this show\n",

are actually totally accepted so do i negative mergentheim sure there are better examples to toby from switzerland sent that one anatol be fun episode because they certainly are as i become a better developer and as you see other debts become more comfortable in their skill set there's a lot of times these see whether it's as enrolls or just like like sort of the gospel that you used to believe you get better as fine as fine yeah i know there's severely some of these things like i said i'm okay with them to some degree and to no degree others but there's a lot of these things that may be leanness while we're talking about many of these different types of facts because you'll see many of them in many different copses all of the time in fact i can it's funny because we spent so much time on these notes and were like thinking well these ones and i just like hutoton now but while there's no room in the sentiment goshenites the apodosis red by two amazing companies century and resuscitates the perfect place for ye to see allegories and exceptions in a distant awesome service that allows you to visualize all of the arsaces see them as their happening see how many people the affecting right you get a little little this is affecting exanthema of users for each of these things you can also see which release it was introduced a few tacatou can even get performance metric foreright do and justabout just a ton of amazing tools if your application developer any type of application website anything that people are using and you want people to have a good experience with the thing you really need a tool just like century abe able to tell you is this thing slow is this thing buggy who grows having issues with this and century is the perfect tool for that job so had on over to century that i owe you the coupon code hasty treat the sentry to i owe taste treat all over case all one word and you'll get two months for free they are also sponsored by fresh book ever may talk about the latter the cloud accounting solution i specifically on a dial in on one thing that saves me a lot of time and that is the physical receipt process as a business owner o the still happens you you go for lunch with the client you buy a box of pens at the store and you have a physical receipt they then need to log to no i hate cats they fade so what i do with those is often an amount i'll just open the fresh books apparatus my home i'll snap a pick a log how much it was right away and then as long as an expense i'll throw her seat the garbage or accuse me and that's the best work flow for doing those actual physical receives luckily a lot of those are sort of going away even now like a scholar starting to know maltreated which i absolutely love physicist with the fresh books abject out fresh books comforts that interest in the hodder about a section on signing up you're going to get a thirty day free trial no critic are quire thinking fresh books response ring i have receipts tearing to him they fade they get everywhere the pages me because like a seperation frances i used to have like a box or receipts on the way home and he luckily that is becoming less and less of a thing i can't wait until there is no more paper my lesbian like working at a company and having with a pretty and with it was having to like collect all the recently know what inopportune have not not actually that lay about it but i am definitely then atarantes gettest here again there is the you said that this would make a great episode because when i read this question and we are picking out our placer the last palace we recorded i pretty much thought to myself there's no way that this could be a polecat to deep too good so i'm glad you picked up on that too so manister with i think maybe we can go back and forth on the ottawa foretaste ones that we feel passionate about minister with negative margins and see us because negative margins are one of the things that is mentioned in the initial question but macnamara's can get some people a little of noise then before eight negative margin is a margin like margin top and the new instead of giving it a positive value you say something like negative two rams are something and this one i had encountered in the wild because i mean i'd been using negative margins myself in my own programming language my own coterie and the first time i encountered some pushpaka when i tried to have some code and a public project with our team i don't remember one of my jobs in one of the developers had a big problem with it was like this is wrong were you doing this why aren't you you thing negative position in right position relative native in the answer is really that they're not the same thing because a negative margin is the justing essentially the entire flow of the dark documents so when you have something and you give it a negative margin everything underneath it all those scots up and then with a position relative negative position or even a translate it's just taking that object in its moving it out of the flow and moving it up and nothing below it is being effected so that is the big difference and it's a totally valid technique especially nowadays where you see a lot of things overlapping on loveletters we do a number of things were we overlappings to give it more of a laerdalsoeren sitting on top of something else and often times you don't need a position absolute to move some things like that maybe you just have a one detached own and other things that's been with up in the whole thing is meant to just give it a more layer effect negative margins superduper validities why we have negative merchants we don't have negative patting and it doesn't work it's because it is totally valid technique so it may seem weird but totally fine i agree with scott there a next one have here is not passing your radical to parse in among seem a little bit coldspring take the string and turns it into an integer and turns into a number one of the ways to represent numbers and joviality with like full numbers another way as with like hevle an if you need to convert them to a proper number and jebri that's what parts it does and the second argument of person is what as it is is that base eight or base ten like bastin is what you're used to normal math but if you're doing he base numbers is going to be base aid or bastien as all kinds of different things out there and there was a amantissima second argument and i was just thinking the other day and i went in to my lalante my career if i actually had an issue with that and i actually went into the docks to say like is this actually an issue to this ever pop up and if you're strong treatise is base and if it starts with anything else it will suit base ten with pretty smart about detecting if it's one or the other and almost always it's going to be that i could see it being issue if somebody you're taking a input from somebody like the alert ere you prompt somebody for an actual value but like again have have you ever had that being issue for you got the only solid iver had with it is the easterling or might let her coming that the hate only in it drives me not because his blood really do i need this is this justine red lion under one in my coat teacloth for me i should also say a lot of these things that i'm saying as probably not a big deal is probable that haven't been bit by it harding probably somebody who's like lost ebion dollars for a bank as listening right now in like well actually we had a customer whose name was zeroing do a position left fifty per cent and then at translate negative fifty per cent in the other direction on the exact as and then will put it in the centre for a long time this was like the way to center things in position absolute now there's a lot of other ways to do this now i think may be simeter options out there could be flexuous have to be container be when hundred vahinee few and then flaxback ianthe center or you could potentially use the new insect property teosinte things but there are still opportunities in use cases where you might not have access to tagaste this the correct way may be don't need you can't have a rapper give or something and you just have a thing and you wanted to set her in a need to be position absolute this one casaubon if it feels weird or happy i don't mind this next i now have here is over writing arguments in a function so another slant oliver popular is don't over right arguments that come into a function so i have a function called sandal or send a product and the actual argument to that function is email in what i do a lot of course platform is just taking the mail and i say email equals email that tolerate and i just lower case and i have a lot rolls that yell at me all the time is as you can over ride an argument maynebrace and then i have to like to think like kalora email a getherin of liquid and i get that in a lot of cases you shouldn't be overriding are humans of a function because you might need those original arguments at some point you might need the untouched value but in many other cases you need to like quickly saw and argument and put it in like lower casing the actual email argument so in that case i'm like a it's fine i still do i i haven't turned that ruloff i still rewrite it to to make a new variable but i always think to myself is this really an issue yeah i don't know this old like i understand your position on this and by a practical account it makes sense to me it still feels wrong this one feels wrong to me and i don't i can't put my finger on it it's the immutability aspect of functions where you shouldn't be overriding it if you're changing it should make a copy and i get it i think i get it but i still some part of me is just a i know there i never do this and never hit this error in my coat because i just literally don't mind my body one let me do it but i understand what you i agree with you but yet the one hard for me not the son interesting one in this one might blow some people's minds if you haven't heard of this before in the past in fact admittedly this is not something i was super well first on until i got a from one of our developers who had used these all over some components missus the non standard chtelet now i'm going to preface the saluting that i'm not okay with it but it's it's actually something that's fine and i'll tell you why i'm not okay with after i explain it a little bit more but as this really interesting so did you know less but you can name in each team element whatever the heck you want in its functionally the same as did with the class of that same thing so if you had an element that was named west and this was just a west tag it's a functionally essentially the same as a dead with the class of west's how the bowered it but more importantly that's how acamas designed was to be justabout are you could just make it up and so i didn't really know this but it turns out after all out of reading about it it turns out its oyvind in fact would the what w how do you say that word you say what would what we hear what working or what is the best quarantine the outhwaites out this when hypercatalectic technology working group the had ever knew that the web hyper text something technology working group that they say that the analysis of custom hags concludes that they are acceptable standard compliant since the handling of unrecognized hags as well defined and more acceptable than for instance tiling a generic diversion is no worse than it dilatation in every mechanical sense in the absence of definition for extortion or component lovel support both mean the same thing both can be styled in the same way and one is hetman element in the others hamaliel and their epicures identical so there saying it totally fine just to make it up yeniseisk what is this i don't i don't like this and developer i don't want to come up my name because i doorway great ideas like heatherstone all these links and it was like its fine man and i was just like you right it's fine why do i feel so wrong missinale shadow on and in custom components are for i guess you're loud whoreson why i decided to to give this the you know the emperor tombstone though we actually have some of these in our cottage because at the time i approved it because i was like you right it's mine walked no argument there at the reason why i have since chosen to say i don't know about this is not because it's functionally wrong is functionally as fine is more based on like a justifee internal style feeling where i want to say he if this is a non standard element make it a component and then it should be kept so if you want to have an nonstandard alemen just make it into a component capitalize but it's fine this blow my mind when i really dug into it i had no idea of this was baldoon interesting thing to spend some time into a few want a dig into more about custom tags when resting i have in fine i'll me ask you follow question about this is what about non standard attributes on an element i've always said no if you're if you're making one up make it a day attainable always dated everything you next one button must have a type so if you this one always gets me where you have a button and you just want to be a regular buttons etseastin type equals button and the reason behind this is because if you put a button without a type inside a formal ament in somebody clicks on that outmatch default to i submit and feel saught accidentally have a semi and when you don't want it and my interest that is usually when i'm using a button that does not have a tip on it i'm outside of a form and i just need a button to postilion like having to say button had begun it seems a bit silly i know that and if the button is outside of formulation that if you're in seaforth make sure you don't have them but there are rules out there that say you must have a type all the time and you must have a button typecase of scott hesitation whenever my linger complains in the said the tawutinaow i like fighting the the man here something dasorian here's what that's not like super hack but it's different something that you will see for a long time the only way to do triangles and cass and howsoever and effectively where your doing as you're setting for borders your setting reborters to be transparent in one border not be transparent and sometimes get just need a little triangle and this little hack to create a triangle has been used and accepted for a long time and honestly i hivories with it i can have some trouble with box shadow there definitely some things to be aware of their but just gringalet triangle downer you want there that's fine height you know i don't need it to be an gortatlea sometimes just need a tiny little triangle and i'm doing the border trick is easy one hand and for those of you who have never done this before the reason why this makes a triangle of your thinking about orders if you have a square othing about it like this if you have a square that they tend picotees and then you tell each of the borders to be essentially inset by five pies each the way that those borders and the becoming inset is they need to have a corner like a picture frame where the contours it ends up creating essentially for triangles that come together and by setting three of them to be transparent and one of them to be a color or a better of opaque anything effectively prattle not a rectangle like you might expect when you're initially thinking so this is a racketeer since the dawn of time and its jettison clear afloat people some people had like beef with that nowadays if you were to say yes that's a hack on pineapple like what are you talking about clearing the clear no float what next only have here is a untamala pass no opener on your target evils blank links so lisas was one that people always preaches any sort of code with a target equals underscore blank on it popularity issue with the rails none you have to put that on there in the reason why is because previously in older browsers if you had a target oceangoing there would be a window opener value on the opened website and that would allow the person to know which webster came from and potentially even have there was some some educate issue where you could have access to the document of the other website that you came from that is no longer the case all modern browsers now scrub that information do not allow access to it so that you don't have to put those on yours any more in those are probably islander off as well i knew that there was a security concern there i knew kind of what it did and perhaps like the general outline of it but i had no idea like the rose specific thing of it of that i was older browsers or antelope got to think about interesting here's one that's fun is the lines now in line styles have long been since the conversation has been like for older develops in lansdale will feel definitely more painful than nor developers because newer developers are probably a little bit more used to tossing some tanerton their recompense the soutar anything like that but older developers were told from day one in line stared their bad bad bad bad bad and it was largely because we had a lot of cod duplication we were writing a lot of like classes in it to an there wasn't component based work flows in straight up tales there is now and so while i don't read and lentiles sometimes there is a point where it's like this thing exists in one spot it would be exceedingly easy for me to just add this immense here and not have to worry about it instances a component it's going to remain dry the main concern about inland style is that they have excessive coping in that they're not dry but this would could be dry if it needs to be excessively scope or are tightly scope than he is it really that a problem other than its clotting up your age tama no the only thing the only reason why i wouldn't do in hornaday in very specific use cases is just because and i kioosta teissier it all into this speaks it that easy to have like sightless as into a fire where you just have a style tag you say oh let me just reference is paragraph that don't even need to give it a class the only paragraph tag in the smile let me just say this paragraph should be be okay in so the only reason why i wouldn't do it today is because well makes it too easy that's pretty much i i think that's it for our hats we have a couple more masora next episode but about that was kind interesting i think for maybe for beginners listening you could know that any time mean here somebody saying something as if it were gospel or any time you see a rule is not necessarily bad practice there belike is some motivation behind why they say these types of things but you almost always you can find somebody on the flopsie of saying like nod it's fine i understand how this work sir i'm totally okay with him i think i think you made a good point about understanding why they work though because i only don't just go do these things willy nilly if you don't essentially know what they're doing or why they're doing what they're doing because then you could get into trouble but if you hit something and somebody i have may be you shouldn't do that if into it again i think that that example about the non standard as camelmen at first was like no no no it was like you to intentionally with your rules turn everything on and as you hit stuff you can greet us too why do you why do was somebody even want this rule on likewise and you can sort of peer into other people's experiences and see why they might have think i can see that and then you can turn it on leave it off or turn it off get it by it in six months and then turn back on the right all i i think that's aiming else nothing not a single thing ewbank you for turning in at you on wednesday beast piacentini doubtfully of followers and don't forget to subscribe in your

should you learn to script with got some really good ones on when how do you add yes lin prettier although things too in existing large project we got some opinions on that some sobriquets we are sore first episode back from thee from the holiday breaks the cotton ire are back with a spring and our step in or stoke to be here we are sponsored by three awesome companies prismatic is a headless smarties internal built tools are new sponsor arsenal about them part with the episode and a log rocket justine will talk about all them part with though the episode happened how you doing man am doing to feel in the revived silliness or he to go had great holiday with the family everybody you know just just emerson kind of amazing energy that comes from like little kids at christmas or just so excited thanatophidia twenty five times like a seriously west every single day we would give our kids a chance to watch like one thing as like a thing here he is your holiday you could to watch something of your choosing right what do you want to wait and every single day my daughter said boedromion actually very good yea were singing all the songs were getting all the animation go everything is good about it yet we watchchain the basement and i come up like ninety wife's just sitting there on the couch of the gosselin watching in condescension and solitarius points of both lucian the pope tramway by the second week of watching these things he was just like all about him so messengers we have here is from perry how do you protect images on your website is there nais the native platform more secure regarding this so i'm assuming he means like is the nauseating images and first of all the answer is a second part is i don't think so but because you can't necessarily just like right click you sore or whatever on your things it can be a little bit more secure but not really an i'll tell you why so i've thought about this a lot because specifically face book in siamese have images that are only allowed to be seen by people who are friends with you whatever you set your complicated thing up to be and with most things and face book and sergius write click view sore or relic copy image you arroyo able to send that your all to literally anybody in the be able to do it so i'm not going to break down roguishly how face book and in sarradets because they probably the biggest example of this on the entire internet so as book an antigrav tokens in the year and those tokens are generated by the user so it'll be like for sashes for lash absinthe and then they'll have a whole long string tokens in the query prattling and usually those tokens are associated with the person that is requesting to view it however that does not stop somebody from just taking that token ye you all and sharing it out to the rest of the world because they will work them i've gone depended this before because i've done faceticae and marketplace graters an i've i am bed insterment my own website via documented apis so they just work you don't have to be logged in tache so a lot of people say like isn't that like a nation of privacy that anyone can just view them and the reality is that somebody who does have access to it as to first get that you all and is no different than if they were just to save the image or two screens it was the native append intention over so in my opinion because the yoursen findable no way you could actually guess where you are all of an istamboul be it's not like photo onto three dupanloup's that i don't think that's really not that insecure you can go a little bit more but if that was the case you'd have to set up your own serve which intercepts every single request sees if the user is lugged in and if they are then you serve up the image aminta's the case then you have to send them the sort of the downside to that is the afther the band with of the image up on the same serveth you're running the cotches the actual image there's other things around the sun once but generally it's much easier just to allow anybody to to see the image if they have the europeans by time you have the early should have access to it yea a lot of interesting stuff there it is funny because if you were trying to like save a photo from minstrels like coping and pasting the yourelf the web portal into another thing or like an instructive like whatever video that i saw and i want i wanted to say that i would i would i would find that i count i would copy in past the web for dodo are all or look at the network request or whatever india i wouldn't think of doing it from the native right because it does feel like the native apes a little bit more secure but you're right i mean you act there's kind of work around for everything but it's right i personally think trying to protect any of that stuff unless you have like a major major interested it is kind of a losing losing game people are going to find work around totally totally it's probably a little different for files then because with a file you can do that and you could just see redirect the seer to the actual file but somewhat different for miles but still again ah it's there's no i don't think there's a perfect solution unless you have lots of resources like literally like severest throw at the thing right to an out o velvetiness firmus i'd like to know how you guiseard typescript did you use the documentation what part of it you are at the whole thing or just what's needed for your project do you guys use an external pool i'm using the hand book i found in the typescript dogs and oh my gosh i get so bored reading it and he stood be very much appreciated thanks and stay of some o let me agree with you so much here i found that you know he tiptoed from perspective of if you know what you're looking for you can kind of go find it but if you don't know what you are looking for in your just going till i get a better understanding of things i do necessarily find them to be that great of me personally i learned heads better by just having to you tube and just googling a bunch of you to videos for people to talk about typescript but that's also just a more fattenin on how i learned better any way is to hear people talk about things rather than to wait them myself for me though the way i learned typescript the best as once i got like a handle on what it was why might want it in some of the basics of the canteen may be some of the like the differences between interface and types in those types of things would be to try to implement a basic stuff in my own projects co these familiar with like things like red one function that might go as even then the coverside stuff might have been a little bit easier for me because maybe it is the lothair to just you straight up singular functions rather than a component and stuff but for me it was really just getting my hands dirty and trying it out and then that was like for the basics of typescript was to just try it and you'll have a bunch of red underlines you're going to struggle to reading the messages in the new gibbet er at it get better at a goethean then you'll feel very comfortable but i started to learn it generates in the more advanced like utility type stuff a little bit better by me personally dealing with and reading advanced types that i found in things like gratcher types for me and then eventually having to write my own co generator plug in so that i had to be the one writing those advanced types so it definitely is a process of getting your hands dirty in really just trying trying trying but you know i agree the testaceous of people like me personally they're going to feel way too dry and way too difficult to really gain a ton of from if you don't know what you're looking for it and like most things hold recommend yes writing typescript forcing yourself to do it struggled through the airs you're going to head times where you're just i don't understand why this isn't you know eventually validating i tried this i tried that i opted just struggled through it read the airs and keep with it and you will improve over time yelled this is a bit of my super power in that when i need to learn something new i will i will literally read the entire dog so i did i read through the entire types cimabue and i just try to suck it all up and not so that like i'm like i read it and like okandandas i understand the surface area of the text and then i go youkahainen that thing put him on to a edentates then again you a little bit more understanding of limit need a talk to lot of people as i why do you use the same wise so good and then once i start a head like a good idea of the pieces what i did is i went to my dobsch course and i converted every thirty every single one of those things over detections great because some of them were just three or four lines ushabtiu impotence couple types for the data that were saving and it was down in some of them were a little bit more involved in it was a great exercise because i just touched upon all benedite projects and and i would say or i would run into situations where there were two ways to do something as typesetters literally two ways to do everything in deprive maybe even two hundred ways to do something yet yewdale one benefit of my huge twitter following as an able just to get some of the smartest people in the world on the stuff just to start talking about it all throttle baby tweet on how would you do this antichristian you get a lot of really good opinions and thoughts and what not which is is really cool and then it just start to use it in project so i start to build stuff in project we talked about my obliges the third not biggest the first one big project i did was the third cellar where i sold to shirts and did the shipping and printed the labels all attesting acanthus well selling t shirts with typescript table it was so that's my approacheth why i sell course is that blood people don't want that sort of like everywhere here there some people just want sit there but down and be mama burned the content in the dunelin fashion and be told all right try the exercise and the cold do it and you can look at the answer and a lot of people learn better that way and partly at appetite my course so this is a bit of a soft ball to my upcoming tempore when that's exactly why i machinating so here ready for that as her yiada little bit of that too where i did like a basic like it was not that like an in depth type script was like typescript for beginner's course in nitidos poor me to like really focus on the navy greenhouse was in winelike water both preconcert that you need to understand here and i think some of those those things can be you know very helpful you have like a specific reason that you need to like diviner things i can definitely force you to to really get into it all right next question we have here is from wastborowe scott please please make your special sound effects scotty i don't mattaponey sorry at the so i've got the basic down haljan in working as a gudruda small company shut iwaya learning typescript now like a sap or stay focused on mastering josip first at one point should i worry about learning types typescript better for some projects over others i thought this was a super interesting question because i so much so that i put it out on twitter like do you guys think about this dollon hand if you learn types and typescript early on your learning a lot about about types about how languages work the areoplane is awesome the errors are awesome and then on the other hand it's just another thing to learn in your when you're a frustrated with learning josip then there's a whole angle brackets everywhere and what not at least what i may approach to this is that yet you should definitely focus on jovian i don't know master javary but get seventy seven per cent of the way there because that's going to show you you're going to start to once you get better adjustments that type ripolin you're going to understand much better look a lot of times i don't understand why i technology is so popular and then i hit the issue in a goat's why people are so over the moon about the thing because i now understand those pains and one of the wittiest thought you should do but a couple of weeks i'll just rattle off rickollections about this as well reannounced i feel that when you start out energy is derived from getting things done instead of doing it correctly after a while you know you can get things done and you get more energy for focusing on how you do it i feel that that appoint type copyhold be interested absolutely i agree with that like when i first started programming i just wanted the dang thing to work i didn't care if it was the best practice or whatever it just needed to work and get done as i got the better arabistan let's focus on like patterns and libraries in the better way to approach this type of thing so i agree with that one i think that's where i'm going to sit on it litter than any in the thing that i could have said causitt be honest i agree will you need energy when you're learning any of this stuff you need positive energy you need and are to stay with it you need energy to push you through all the red underlines and all the broken code and exceptions all that stuff so you need progress and it is tougher to make progress when you have issues coming from multiple sources or maybe you don't know if this is the typescript thing or a job as citing so i definitely agree you need to get you need to get some understanding of jobbers understand what problems types coldevin solving i don't know if you yeasting job script no i don't i don't think there's a handful of people who you could say master josepha that's like such a bit bathing even say so don't necessarily even worry about that his worry about getting proficient understanding what does what where to go for what and then move in move into typescript in yeadon think i would have even like understood why typescript would have having some understanding of life the pains that it had caused me in various points of my life so yeah i think that's good advice one more thing and this indian reassured on the script for the back end of the thing because of how awesome the article was for the learners but i dilate almost everything in that like it would just work implicit any and all that stuff to even of his broken typescript it will still run in and why because at the very basic you can just write jabad get to the really nice articulate in lots of cases because the inferred submitted that i just write your gravestone going that step further and trying to find types for you when you are reading just judge asked piles but maybe just turn on it as laxafiord cinating for it yeah i agree with it that could be nice you know else could be nice west as one of our sponsors prisoners manatees messieur dreams west you aneta about it presumes that it's a headless means that you lagidae your content types you relate them to each other they haven't really cool approach to building website though and they've reserved up the tinkled slice machine a slice machine at dave and the whole the whole idea of it is don't ship pages ship a page builder and in what that means is instead of saying all right here's the about page than the apothecaries in a bio and things like that you can get your ship components you ship a details component a person component in image component and then a button component of video company anything you want and then you have all these components they call them slices and prismatic you can you can have your necks or your next as or you know whatever component you have but then you haven't associated said input for that and then you basically say to your end user pay i made all these lego blocks you can go ahead and build the page and literally use any of them that you want o you you kind of just give him a page builder and the cantercot me a couple of paragraphs give me a simeltaneous and you need a sort or even if you want to likeness of approaching your website go to president they have a whole bunch of examples there as well and you perissons oranges go well led to into the next one is forced happy holidays at the holidays miami be cheating the bed since there are few related questions in this one how do you decide what to learn do you prefer to be an expert in a few things or know that about everything how do you guys handle aloive big de grasses of greener on the other side syndrome i always start learning something in the near about another thing and shift that before doing enough in the previous thing sometimes i keep cycling back and forth or worse another contender for my attention appears and i switched to that because it's better after some time i feel like i made a little progress in each of them because my attention was spread to then i feel like on the type that would rather know more about the ticular topics than a little about everything but by grasses greener syndromes me from doing that hothouse to what you want to learn in stick within me comfortable with the choice knowing that there's something much something much better out there ostistuen you a lot there's always something new and better in whatever and people even joke you know i move my library or my whole problem to sit and then i did a course on the astronomers on remind people have joked of me for both of them are gotteridealen a strain no you know but the answer for me is to commit to something is that most often never going to rewrite a platform in something else most often i say that is my house that but you know that that platform was erected for a very long time and if i'm committing to a project i'm committing to the project in the way that i started at the way that i wrote it and then i will use that project to expand to many times people really gets stuck into things because it's just what they use at their job right we use rails at my job so therefore i may railsplitter therefore i use react for everything and then in those regards you kindelon that and i think that's such a good thing to do is to be stuck in something like that because he does worse you to get deep into top exited at those topics and you have enough time to really explore that but when you're just like a noorse learning experimenting on projects he's harder it's our it's definitely harder to do that i will take some self control in their is going to be self control involved here you do need to say hey what i rather you kind of have to paint it in a picture of like what i rather advanced this project that i'm working on or would i rather keep the project exactly where it is and we write it from scratch usually enters i i want to advance this thing i want to make it better i want you involve it i want you abner and whatever more so than like i want to expand my knowledge right i want this project to grow an evolved i don't want this project to stay stagnant because that's what happens i wrote i took half a year last year whatever to rewrite the platform insult and what happened alive the features were working on took the huge back seat and you know the features and the improvements of the sight that we wanted to make as far as features went they didn't get to advance because we were focused on changing the platform diomedes so how do you learn or how do you stick to that honestly i think it is just a matter of working with self control or potentially forcing yourself to do it to say like maybe he outreaching there's no threnodia wouldn't recommend necessarily hopping around too much in one project or another without without like really evaluating if that's honestly what you want to do they i think as debauching object syndrome in that is something new comes out and now i hear a couple of people the hipping it up on twitter and you think it all that that's the next thing i you on a move to that as quick as possible so i don't think that you should really worry about fameuse if any of this talk is here to stay you will know that and in six months a year or two years from now it will be dominant and are not necessarily dominant but of libel liked and wellspring libellous and you divisions to get into something that a stable and well documented then the brain new thing necessary and i think also like finishing a project is a flax being able to actually do that last twenty percent of a project and ship it out the door is going to push your skill so much further than jumping around from one thing to another and always talking about the sheep all the time were there always just talking about whatever is brand new and to a point that is scotty because we're telling you what's newark said about it but on the other side of thinkin of just got a pick something and stick with it you don't want to be that guy who is always just talking about the new stuff but never actually doing anything with the stuff you know and we attack about the new stuff because i mean that literally or do i take for the new theaters in the pudding just finish your stuff and then detect you can try setting out out elsbeth i think the pain of switching and jumping on something that is brand new and shiny as one often underestimated because of how quickly they pisanese at all that thrashing and pichan and up grades is is really frustrating after a while so take it for me a grizzled old developer who has done that many times next question we have here is from alasia a friend and defiant to become a full stock and learn a backalong which one should i choose jebusite question noonoon there's lots of good back in languages out there and i am obstinate beats being able to write the same language for your back in an your fun and an scottish unremitting beats being able to write the same language in the same file for your run anicette as a front adeline what happens on the servers is starting to blur and i believe we will start to see a lot more of that we'll start to see a lot of like freneau becoming full stadacona matter where it's running is just just josiah day so i would double down on your dobigel that you'd eveleen go back to our fundamental severine fundamentals episode he seldomest what cookies are what were quests are in rowing and usefulest all these major concepts and no asseline to do that right now but it's you probably are no job script so that huge benefit ahumada anything to additional sarrasin opinions there aright whatever the latest and greatest thing is that i don't know that i'm going to have to spend time learning that's what i'll not just joking don't demonstrator media aquarius when i tried to implement the individual come components they seem to be ignored could that be an error on my part there is nothing weird about mediocres insults rich you doin something weird less you say that but i will say that there is something that you do need to consider here specimens in their says i are really strongly scottish you write is strongly scope to that component unless of course you are using the global modifier and it looks like a little acorn function in a global and that could be potentially why you're seeing submiss may be the code that you're trying to augment it with that media query is not actually in that component and because its strongly scope to that component that that the issue you know it i really without seeing some corocotta very well may be the issue but if you're having issues with medicare inspectors manatos likely either because of the scooping or it's because you wrote you mediatorial so two things and i think that's probably it wow i can't believe richardetto pelties amonition is from cantorwitch as a south asolani dab i often find myself intimidated by the task of implementing things like author payment platforms is hard to know what you don't know and making mistakes with these tychonis of serious consequence any advice or suggestions on how to approach the things of the state he thersites a couple o things in web development that what you don't know can get you in trouble accessibility is a big one alicia if you are building a website and you make it inaccessible you can be fined for that even if you don't know you kind of have to know those things right and the off is a big one you're trying to secure things in your application and people could access ithacan access it and that's a big one as well as the other one he mentioned here payment platforms as obviously a bagonet one is a lot of the time striptease because stripe handles all the oopathi but the answer to this is if you don't know what you are doing than you can have these things alloted by you so you can go to another developer that you trust and say he can you like run through this and asked me all the questions or you can find just some of these you can there's everything from scriptis who are trying to get bulbousness and just run a test we against it to see if there's any common errors that will happen and then there all the way you can jhampanies in what they say that will do a quick audit of your application make sure that there's there's nothing weird going on there there these are normal things to be intimidated by to tannersville about that because at intimidating payments intimidating those are maybe even like two of the biggest most intimidating things out there soengedaeae approach them as if they are approachable but also like take it stepaside i did a course on authentication and before i did that course often occasion it did scare me i was one of those things i was like i can't do authentication it's too hard but then when you look into it there are very explicit steps this does this then this does this than this does this then this does this and if you break it down into those individual steps take it one step at a time you'll get the big picture and i'll make it that much easier and then you can try to implement it herself but honestly the thing that helped me the most when approaching either of these things which is things i've had to do myself ought thereanent proclamations is to take it stepaside right out the comments specifically the comments without touching any coating to first take the plain text password i'm going to send that to my server my server is then going to create a hash of that password is going to solve that hashanah right tithes are the individual steps in your gonorowsky what it does before you even touch any code and to me that made it the process much nicer for me personally if your diving into anything that intimidates you it's probably best to have some sort of error exception handling service may be one of course that could give you a visual output of what you are seeing going wrong in one of these platforms is longfrock t in a love rockets diseases on replacing on your website with a video scribble all reply as he lit a literal video that you can see the clock happen and then the air population they got the new work request you can even get things like the reducing reductively really really goberment ones that i personally is all the time to help me solve errors because there's nothing worse than asking your clinton of information about their platform sometimes you still need to do that in any way but this thing is just another tool that you can have in your investigators tolbooth and solve some bugs and this is one that really helps you turn the lights on moneylending worth the solvent bugs in the dark so check out log rocket at log rocket dotcom bordenton up and you'll get fourteen days for free this is one of those services that you really got to try to check it out thanks so much for labrador sponsoring or right next stepsister next episode at next secession here is from a bandanas any experience working with a team on the different times on any tips so dan i have a small team so take that as a caveat to this answer here is a small team one of which are developers is a digital no mat he works from literally anywhere sometimes i'll messman obtain this country i'll be like wine you move to this country just that i take a couple succulents in this country over here and it is very funny because he denounces all around and because of that we've had two really developed systems for making sure all on the same page so the biggest one is going to be communication in your processes in your system for communication now obviously this is going to change the more people you have involved here but i think the theaetetus tracking is tight you have everything assigned to people if there's an issue somebody needs to be looking at something they need to know that they are the person who is now holding the ball if you're passing the hot potato to somebody they've got another holding the potato or else it's going to blow up and everybody's faces right we just played hoppetty kids in case you can't tell that is with the pterosauria commit messages very clear you state explicitly what branches thereon or you have a system for the branches sometimes we don't do this any more but west have our branches be the gittites change it a little bit but that could be something that's very helpful either way the biggest most important thing is that you you always have up to date code if if you expect somebody to be doing something you always have an up to date code in the remote location whether that is get up or whatever you always have up to date code there you always have every one's task listed as who's doing what every one should always know what the status of things are and that's really it taken additional hour at the end of each day to flush your communications commit push up a sign things tweet things ad priorities and those types of things that everybody will be on the same page that way it doesn't matter when someone's picking up they can open up their computer see what things are assigned to them what things are in high priority what they have to work on and pick up from it there again that the bigger the team may be the harder that's going to be i'm on talking side organizations here but if you have ten people on your team pontypool these kind of things should definitely work also communication channels like slackened get a little bit harder when people aren't on the same time on because you can't just pinged so again having a singular place as like thee the gethsemane to do system but like if you have those systems of isaiah whatever that is really the biggest thing to make sure your organized there i've been working with itasca for a while and it's seven our difference so if you're working a regular nineteen hour really overlap and also doctor the folks from keystone there in australia which is very very hard to get any for laughter in esoterism is just remembering what time it is in the other times one when i was a contractor i work with a lot of people from the yoke a lot of people on the east coast and i started using this appalled clocker of only just got it today because this exactly it's funny that i question is here because issue i have is it a little as much as i hate men yuara i just want to be able to cook on a button and see what time it is in that whatever other times one so my sistently in saskatchewan and descends not have daylight daylight savings so if half the year their two hours behind other half of the year there one hour behind which is the nongkause it changes because we do have delighting so this will be just click it down i will tell you what time it is in the times one i use isteinism by the way alisande that year you can set a puncheon have as many as you want and then we'll have all the clocks ahadarra samite best yeah i said manorhouse tipcat like a year ago scott as also ye oratama i'm going to matthiette up after this call ingerid o'clocker so there's that in the just being aware of the blest tried to do things a lot of it has to be done a synchronously so the first thing i do in the morning is try to answer as many questions as i get asked and make sure people aren't blocked on specific things and then that's really the best i have it's the other thing is that sometimes oolustee sometimes you got to jump on the computer at nine pimentoes you it's really tricky for me to do early because he had to bring the kids to school and things like that but that's tasseroni have fortunately don't have to do it techeechee outside i time one he asked him likewise and i think that is important now that time zones and everything like that in an even finding ways that like one thing that i like to do is relitive cameron and stuff and if you're on a map you can quickly record a screen recording sometimes that is like like one of ours this is this is not a pay at read here for one of our sponsors loricatus the session replait in that really helps you to solve bugs but in the same regard you can take that video approach to solving bugs and issues by just straight up greenhorn your local environment to say by the way this is what i am saying can you help with this when i do there this happened that can sometimes be much better than trying to explain it because a straight of video somebody doing something is usually it better indicator of what happened then then like a text one line by line here's what i did clocklike sometimes can help there we lie those tools to say hey this is one on seeing this is what's going on can you take a look oh alene same lines less about them the clock you know the estates as the clerks in whatever anyone of my first above have an employee of were living in la and germany and all manageable like you'd see like a newsroom they had like analogous up on the back wall that were like a germany in arborage of them so you could just like turn around and look at the wall the sewatis like real analogical the different times ones at that theistically to do it that was so like as it was to intellectualistic attitude somehow i didn't know that the sun there so you just add locations can you like name the locations like after people i don't know about that for me i wish headlike the i just had an there i too and whatever whatever city therein yeah yeah thanks answers i don't know that's really that much of a mental barrier to say all right here in this city who do i know let them descension a big deal when i when i did consulting some like the project manager they've got thirty people there meeting with in the know like they have to console thinking ah honestly ones and katie to schedule the meeting in your time you know like of calanthe you know yet you just tell them to book something with you in your open spot as may be a better approach harry a next one we have here is a question from addle wives from beautiful nor was i really like this question because i just decision myself thanks for the great boncassen to it when i'm out running inspiring and i learn a lot and here about services i should check out but never get to beautiful aminta working on a react project with five dabs and three more who have been on the project previously when i got in there was no goliba in as larues caused a thousand plus warnings on each build we got rid of them introduced materially material you menomonees you may imagine as i won't read the whole the whole question is people get more of that i get to the point here as you may imagine at least many different coats styles and developers from almost sixty thousand lines of code i would like to introduce prettier to avoid all the discussions on cottle syntax et cetera et cetera but the the problem is is that prettier correction would ruin the entire geister which sometimes is useful for whom it the coat how old it is what feature a bugis last changed perhaps a get history would make those previous comments available at least partly so this is really interesting i just did something similar on working on a big update to my course player in we had something like i think it was a sixty thousand between esslingen prettier just tiny little things like i had changed a bunch of rules and had run it and in a long long time and it was insane how many i was and you have condotto options when you are like orissa big big project you can go near where you just run up all at once you make one commit and you fix everything that can be fixed in one go or you can do it as a donated basis where it okamoto this fall right now let's use the viscount to save it and when it saves it will reform at it and then you sort of just go through the coat base as he touch different files and whenever you're working on something you change it so initially thought all you do it on assist because it seems so overwhelming to do all that type of thing and i quickly learned that that the pain in the ass because when you want to work on a new feature you don't want to have to fossette's not a big deal pretty edifice is it but a forest land rolls little things here and there you have to actually re factors what i did i just i just hunterdon two hours and like a it sounds silly they was sixty thousand errors or for edouard thousand funny they were like like thirty eight thousand of them were just like little spacing indentation quotes extra lines imports that were unused things like that and then those are just got got cleaned up very quickly and then i just went through each file one by one and took about two or three but two hours to go through it all and get it to the zero which felt pretty good i will always love those typesetting on the test and then you have less and every single time you run it you've less and less and less yust tried to get it down to to absolutely zero i asked this on twitter as well atwater i much prefer the god nuclear couple people mentioned that culpeper mention that it has a ignore revisions flag when doing again history you can put this in your detonator just use as a flag when you run it and it will specifically ignore those revisions and show you the commit efore that so pretty sweet that i think that's the answer to that right now and probably do it all at once and not another really good point that someone had in this is how i did it as well as you do all the fixable ones that don't actually break your code prettier knocking a break your coat i've aisier run into a situation where prettier broke the functionary of the code good among that but yes litres can break your coat things like resigning in argument you know you have an argument coming into a function in the you like an example as i have a function that takes into email address and then i want that marese lower case but slanted make a new variable called lower case e mail and then take the argument and lower case and what i was doing as i was just overriding the argument i was being passed in island and like that so i had to re factor of the coat a little bit and there's a possibility that you introduced bugs into your soft were at that point so i would do those in separate commits and then make sure they were a have tests for those things let's coast of the way to approach that so anything that reliques acres ould maybe be in a separate commit maybe even a separate poletes teanie followed that one too intense i do think that one of the things you mention here that a just turnin and vasco and only update the violets you go is definitely an option to we did that recently even with type script it was like eminently different because that can definitely changed some things in your coat base at all but we had that issue where was just like you know what were whenever you work enough file that file should end with no type scrapers but it very well may start with the scripters so that that worked well for us and it took a wasn't like it wasn't like a short process it took a course of time because there's just some files you never tie tominiscoes open up a can of worms and all sorts of pinguitude work well i think for us colourlessness from alex less what are your thoughts on monorhina all of your company's coat in one managest versus separate repositories for different coass of the show piece out okasise some of her older episode people asked about monrepos in that i think i personally have the wrong idea about monrepos the past it i use a minaret we have several packages in the monopole have our ape have argueello nui everything in the manorhouse pantops to organize all of that and iwillie like it i think it's great i think it's fantastic and the hardest part for us was like we wanted to have some packages private and some packages public of which we ended up using somadeva though some people not liking some modestine working out just fine frost but i got to say having a monrepos been very very good for us because wonting that we can do as we can write small little packages of ferdousi the different packages you can use reference those as if they are real packages even if you are not publishing them somewhere for instance i know works spaceline this in an or in kind of work similar aleander flesh shared in the accusation our share utility functions that way woothery all of our day utility functions more than once we don't have to write in a outrance more than once a ethothion one spot and we don't have to worry about cotillion or bugs and being introduced by having it not being available so what do we think relentlessness the notations being moved over to a montorio's going to be less of a bosmans and might be more of a bonneterie to hear your thoughts on this because i talked to dorat that a long time ago before was like a vilipend yeah interested i'm i am interested because it's supposed to be turbaries supposed to be very fast though it's like a bull system for monrepos so if you've got fifteen packages in your montereno need a billiter that a sort of dossiers bought them i supposed to be super fast there's another one called anaxander parley that one is wicked fast as well probably like the checkens well to see i don't i don't know if the speed is necessarily going to be an issue for me but i began an interesting to take a look at both of these the biggest pinpoints for me west would be like that up neediest up a new package you got to think about bildeboy if you're using like yet stultior whatever i don't want i don't want to have to have a unified bell system but there are times when i'm like you want to write this in type script and i wanted to be consumed but i know i have to set up a bill to convert its jovial this stuff is kind of a painting the but there oh yeah interesting so that was just like like an hour ago so and don't know i don't have any opinions on that just yet so maybe we'll do a show in a bunthorne repositor build tools in that regard lookeedesee by a new sponsor to day that is retold that is our toolooah one of those sitooation homage inspiration positronic looking it is also an amazing tool for building internal tools that right if you're building tools like wesendonck about love building internal tools but a lot of times you need the internal tools to just work and you don't want to spend the time having to act together a form library or anything like that orator or cardinay woodrow you to do is to start shipping to day because they have their own built in components which are all amazing and you can connect your data sources and there is a fort plus native integrations including seventeen different database you can connect anything with an aponeuroses from a single a and you can even write custom components when you need to so if you're building administration to be there to help you conington and detect to conform to database schemes there's a bunch of pre built components that reduce your time and make it fast for you to start shipping internal adventoors it's a dragon drop builder with cod features and eight on overall cool stuff whether that's table list charge forms wizard mass and all sorts of things deference out recitative a bit video right in the home page right doncasters and his is used by a ton of fortune five hundred companies many of which allagatuh you will recite designs fantastic there's a ton of features and is built for developers so this isn't some sort of a toy or anything like that this is a legionese have access to revision history with get you can host on premising rancorous and audit logs it just too many things to to list here in fact we'll have to talk about more about retooling because i honestly there's many different tools here so give it a try check it out at re tool dotcom forward slashaway build internal as that move your business forward in a fraction of the time\n",

is west based one line is funny stories actually how i met my wife but this jacopone letter so you are dorotheenstrasse within it's been her sponsors that you can use together it's like a happy little happy little family landis cloud computing the developers trust they offer linieres that you can fire up an run the literally run anything you want on it you can get dedicated spores you can get high memory boxes you get boxcoat you can run cooper nettie's on them if you want a spin up a whole bunch all at once they have loaded bounders and do protection you name it they got it i personally run a bunch of not allegations on land its pretty sweet you want to check it out they're goin to give you a binding your hundred bucks or frere i think you and for sponsoring thank you this alonso century and century do i owe the perfect place to see your ears an exception happen and attract your performance metrics and so much more now century is one of those and is one of those tools that has so many tools and a just it's a joy to work in to use these tools into sea alive them working together so well you can want to do is head on over actresses outhouse the coupon code a treat all one word all the work castelletto months for free of this erection handling service trifling about some of my favorite century tools they be one that i haven't talked about there's really great thing where you can tagelei in versions to your century and that way any time you're pushing up a new version of eruption its locking those airs as being attached to a specific version now lointaines it really nice to do is be able to see like all right this application is that this person crasher this version of this application had this many crashes the meningitis of depletion as this many lieutenantcolonel ease if you are making less mistakes over time if your team is getting better at your process and you can evaluate your teams process just based on that release tracking stuff it's really supernatural more tools though there's some user feedback tools you can get alert you can set up alert of maybe a track in specific bug you can see who is introducing the most bugs in your application if you like or said them straight to give habitues so many features in century it's just about impossible to togather check it out centration upon cohasset all over case all one word all one line if i dare so let's talk about some one liners i asked on twitter and a complete whole bunch of my favorite on lines that i dusted and i will put the cod for all of these in the shootin comitatus rock them but this shorty simply to do you the first one is a four a temporary and mostly unique idea this was then a question from one of our ocasional not name them this is what i need a temporary and most unique dismasted times sorry one fifteen and what that is is one to the power of fifteen which is one with many zeros after it emanates whatever and then you matamora that will give you a random number in the way they say that is most unique is that if you need cryptographic ally random numbers you should not be using mathurine because of something he had latest if you are doing poor banking or anything like that that you need random numbers to be actually random then use the crito package in note and not just mataram eoumelian the so many of the times you you don't need that now you know you don't need something that happy over the ninety nine per cent of the time unless i'm working on authentication i just need a quick ranimer this could job done next is going to be to grab a random color now i've never used this before but it looks like what is doing here is is going to generate a six digit code and then add in the emersion of it turn it into a evaleen less is that that that what's going on here a yeah this is one from paul irish posted this twelve years ago on his log and i've been using it ernestine abrahamsen seven seven one two and i believe that is because that is the upper limit of what he numbers go to and then you to string it with baited that will turn it into an actual code and not a designer need a random random color you got it there that's lionne a lot of these are kind of fun here is a another one for west and actually this is funny westheath one but i have a key board short cut up to do this exact thing for me so if you do counsel log in then have each property in your counsellor the sarthe argument of counsel being object with each of the things you're intelligent halliard short cut for me it's just command ellen teachwell take whatever string have highlighted in turn it into a consulate thing as a property of an object is super duper and very quick and easy is basically labels for your counsel log another thing you could do would be to have a string of whatever your labeling next to it came of the thing or wanting to out this is a little bit cleaner i think it is a saltatory of restructuring properties into a function is great but it sometimes annoying to log those all because they are distracted in the three or four fripperies right so i used to do that and i found that it abolition suggest it if you console and open curly bracket it will suggest consoling all the properties of a function that are structured and one very happy to see that i do like my little i liked command out because it works for multiple properties to somewhere one is anything this is one that i often sent to people who want to change something on their invoice on my things you know what i forgot to pay existence and i can't get it refunded and less says that so what i do as i tell them o percolating document to design mode equal one and then it will essentially just puts content edible on the entire body and then you can literally i use your curse and type and back space into the entire document the whole thing as edible when you turn this on lobenicht simple little plug into right you could just have like a little button that hangs out on the side minesweeping i have the billing address content edible on because that's the thing that everybody everybody coup and they want a change to get their envoy approve and i do by just turning it on the entire invoice because like in people should be able to take the price of the thing right so i don't turn that on intentionally but sometimes people need to change other pieces of it just to make sure it gets approved yeah the i did kind of what you did there too i can talk a blank text and put and people can eat whatever they want eatum or whatever ye when you when you're buying it there's a big box assister you need on the importin the box and we'll dump it onto the employees it's that's the problem with the world wide people neither on the invocation something one little bit here but you know what i have the temporal dat i been messeter picene job was citation myself and i tontaine something that could be used in the future and this is basically just to get today right now and you can get it as i have the typescript in here so one remove the typescript aspects of this so you can get the just right now by doing capital tea temporal dono got plain date is and then that gives you a variable in which you can do all sorts of things like to day dot day today not moody do year in so obvious and simple once you have that plain date because what you and i having in the temporal apis you end up having plain days plain at times you have maybe one day an times but the plain day is just right now without a time on give me right now give me to day irritates is a nice little one this won't work in most browsers unless your polly following the temporal epic if you're using the temporary pier going to have to pull you filibusters in the future but how great it is to just be able to say that day methodical here is counsellor inside of an implicit turn so one of the biggest pin in the butt with using arount on with an implicit return as that he can't popanilla there because it's a one line to return the little track is you can consult log the value and then say or and then continue on with the rest of your imperator and because consolatorily run consular value and then cut a log always returns undefined then it was a no and the aback to the next thing so that's just a little trick to your consul i've i've mostly moved away from using impetus in react components because of that i much rather just have another the free you can have is manliness you as have an extra line with the return you can hammerer to you what an intact it is the big thing like that is there anything like a little bit to frustrating when like you have some like a filter fronton or education that's not working in the new have an implicit return in their eringoes curly brackets and whatever is so this is the nest one cause it is that is a noosepaper in things like moveless to another holderness of the tripod base in it something that all editors can now take advantage of me let me let me put peccator on the list of hasty for next year she's some interesting stuff there cook so now we're going to get into a sea one here here's one from twitter from matt matt mc sherry and he says to remove a prop you can structure and essentially you do constant your brackets to destructor the property you would like to remove coma and the data the rest of them is the equal to your object it's also works for a raise too you can do that with the race to hers the first itineraires the rest of them and by distracting signed operator saying like here here's the first one and now defining it as a thing an here's the rest of em and effectively your now able to have a subset of that first set whether that is an object of oraetes the penal the time i a personal uses all the time i use this one to duplicate database values i feel like i've talked about the fore but i'll say it required you have like a day to base item has like the their name their age and their way in the end of that use and you want a duplicate that person and then say it to a database you just duplicate it but you don't need the idea property because they property comes from the new base so you can count it come out that he did the rest and not that'll do i just take the rest of the things that were not structured and that you can pass that to your database safe command yes linnell you because you should the prop that you removed as unused but who cares who care some one you put a underscore front of it and then they have it yes lineage it or sing if it starts with underscore that's why do and to underscores if there's two unused ones also like spreading in the release fulfilling it creating a new array like i often do considers equal to flat brackets that that out older a and then there being no langoyran new array so great new raise objects with restructuring and spreading a line exhales ph style a debugging so in peaceful is pretty common just to dump your object into the shoalwater and then stop rotating the tips in the inner southampton that i moved as you can string a fire your object or a ray and then use the next argument is nothing in them the third argument is a space it will formation a nicely indented object and then you can jump that into a pre element a pre element will maintain any spaces and then it just doesn't nice view have a react component called dump you look on p west boss for usedom and it's exactly for that just one of ventilation and not in your consul that's what you said next little trick we have here is if you want a destructor if you want to get the first and last items from an array in a single structure normally when your structure in a secure brackets right but because the rays are objects you can also use curly brackets the destructor and array and then use the objects properties amusing air quite because that what properties are on an array zero one two three four all the properties are there indexes and then there's one more property on arastras the length property so what you can do as you can destructor and rename it into first you can restructure the length property and then the third thing is you can destructor length minus one to last variable and that's kind of interesting i never knew you could do this as you can use the structure variables in the next structured item and you can just pull them all out at once on antonines here's a light little one too for those of you who like to listen to things quickly like i do an i know west as this well if you can querelam be even you can quality any of these things which is the audio or video element on a page in these things these are at male elements right if you do query document out corselet and then in these string property to save video right for audio come vitiate your trying to do it usually it's just one of the two of these things right and elude dot play back rat on the element that had finds is equal to and then it is a number value so you do document aquarelle parentheses strain video string parenthesis do play back readest you're going to set the video player on the site to be at play background listen to them at will he could be seen by many people as a normal speed is very funny i listened to some non techstone a light called into one of their hither call lines and was like a list you guys are two x and they were like making fun of the guy their life who would listen to a pocasset extasies come like namedst now this me i do that yealmpton it is innocuous oyster like story telling one's all listen to little bit slower because i'm i'm there to enjoy it not to just get the information out of it a tolendal ones like syntax hallstatt ex goedike the other threw it as quick as possible in this steinbutter sentiment in the car or on speakers i have to have my settler a one point five or one and a ahahnheeattoepahk you make a veritable called or function called sleep that returns a promise in that promise resolved after however many milestones this and it literally the same that i have in a package that resolves after howieson that's really handy he is need to wait for a second or if he even need to await zermatt end of the cossack because you're having issues with that nice i'm going to finish up with one that was kind of kind of her for it but i'm not i'm taking in here casters there was alike very kind of specific and this is very general so this is that you can do if statements on one line without brackets now some people really hate that so you're going to want to make sure that your coatings or kind of cottington especially if you have like a lot of different maybe potential cases it may be the match match method that's coming salome of these things but you know i often do like if this thing return thing into it all in one line without having any sort of brackets without having to do that the whole rigmarole of a practice which i know that's going to make some people upset but i do end up using this quite a bit if thing returned bagot's the line so nicanope that you do not always need it curly brackets on your statements if that is part of your cooing guidelines beautiful so those are some cool one liners we actually have no five or six more maybelle those for the next time we do this as always fun just have these little one liners in our oracle not necessarily you're going to use them sometimes you use them sometimes they get you out of a pickle belasco interesting to look at him you like what does that do and how does that work because it's just like a little just a little kick flip of gravity just look at flippancies they sometimes they get really too with it is and molteno witan what is sometimes seen in obscenities led code sides and though belike all right we want you to do this in this in this in this in this tennessee twenty two and we will be catching you on wednesday for the next episode that's offer now as bateato senator forgiver shelves and don't forget to subscribe in your bobcat player or drapery if you like this show\n",

less induce warburton i actually lived in chronologer our friends apollinaris a different country there ornamented that would come closeland to do pluck for you only bring food that her dim but i haven't had a mandoline a long time just because like all my friends have like eleven kids each right now and nobody hangs out any more so i just sat on the couch and have my own deploiement my office one time when i was working and he was working at a record a bull and he just showed up asking if the boss was here and i didn't know who he was was amelie and he liked came in asked the boss out mignonette them deplore and it was just like oh yes this is famous got you can tell just by it's funny when famous people come in to wherever you working you can always conditores like very very much answereth everybody else the coldspring a t shirt but you know that the castle three hundred bucks or something so he was very obviously was wealthy i had that with us it matamoras i was at some like secret concert there like people merited me to like can't tell you what's happening but come some like come and that i was just a sky walking around a huge hair in a big coat and stuff was like wisigarde deadened being the quarterback for the university of michigan who were like adults about sponsors who that sanity and law rocket all talk to you about sandy sandy is the unified content platform that powers better digital experiences but the does that mean well they are partaking sizer part developer experience basically if you have a website and you need a somewhere to put all of your data that's what sanity is they you create it you can create account you create all of your schemes you relate all your content to each other you can say this is an image you can hook it up with a bunch of different providers you could hook it up another one of our sponsors muckman you can have your video streaming from there they have a really sweet like you i for ending the content which is like one one of the major draws because the marketing folks the lawyers pretty much ever loves to use the you i for editing an approving their contents called sandy studio it's pretty sweet chickasawhatchee usage ter thank you sanity for sponsoring what you're talking about experience is let me tell you about logrono that isn't experience lacertis the perfect experience for your errors in exceptions because you actually get to experience them with a scribble video reply as in straight up you can see the user clock on a thing that broke the thing that caused you so much pain and instead of them having to email you say had clicking and broke you can say onotowatishika ever saved your bacon is never helped me in fact leaving it lets us regenerate has been the only way ever solved issues around resenting as there's a lot of stuff in sweeter you're like this is a painting with her dependencies for to me peer to pendergest in the way when the really there to stop issues from happening with incompatible pieces of software so package lock dogali you ever crack it open it will detail down to the actual version like the packages have you ever semantic version in which is like three point two point one and then each of those point releases means that like a minor update new features added and in the third one is a breaking changes a whole new version and the package lock will tell you the clothes you used to devote that website that when you do that sucker to your website when they animal that on your host you're getting the same package versions and the whole idea was member is that like if you develop with version two point one point one and then by the time you employ that thing to point one point two came out those are different pieces of software and is supposed to be that nothing broke because this just a small little point release but sometimes it does release and i certainly had that issue with my papal years ago when i deployed my website for a launch i built it and in between me building and me deploying it the next day they released the version that broke something and it made all of my papalini whenever i tell you really are not models i also tell you the leakage walk that jason is he sometimes eat like a weird version or something installing properly in this is a good way to just wipe it all out and start fresh yea in the lock miles nothing new i mean and if you use rails or an these other package base things the lock file is to find something that has been there for and i i mean rubrical but the papaloi differentia aconitin that exists in many other languages so it has the makon before but i think most the time it saved your bacon or a time that you look just flattening the donnotaurus divert you and banality but you need that thing in your need that in your back in your or in your first control right next question as from a manual he says why do you guys hardly say anything good about angular is it obsolete or do you just not care so densely is this that we just don't use angular angular has a big community a lot of people use angular there's a lot of various smart people working on an angular so angular is definitely not obsolete it's not bad i just don't use it it's a poet's whole thing right and because it's kind of a little bit more all encompassing solution compared to some other things that you will you end up getting a little bit less of that outside bleed from other communities into the angular community because they are so kind of in their own world so that really really why i don't think it's a bad choice thathanabaing attention to essentials aurungpore for still a copperhead then i went to tell scott but it and then i refrain and that must have been a service worker of being cathedrals time i visited the angular estate which was obviously last year or two years ago now her illinois next year but then i refresh it was gone so that must have been a just a service worker that and that's a service workers work and they serve up what's in the cash and then they check the new version and if the new version is updated then the next time he refreshed the page or you can also prompt the user or just literally window to refresh and i'll get the new version to inheritance for me if i was the guy cranking out a react and angle of view a spell and like six other framework courses because that means i obviously don't know that like the intricacies of every single framework i begat i could put out a course on all of these but i much rather you take a course from somebody that akkibosa form and i've been using react for however long and has not to say i won't ever use other frameworks in my course but i'm not going to dive into absolutely every single frame out there it's just not oughten the world hither both spread than enough as it is totally and there's people that people always ask the sweeps or scotland sees to link ruby or angular or paper whatever and they just need to like there's people like us in every single tack there's out looking learning from them whereas a non like scott but there's plenty of merriment and i don't know of any one is ever told you but then humour the amazing content and the hard work you pour into the show no one ever told us that think you can be consistent even if the topic is a relevant to my skill set i'm looking at you react at penny that people have said that a lot i don't use react but i still listen but maybe that's good cause scott doesn't use racah these days so now we've got more diversified content my question is how do you handle package updates for example i'm working out a full sack at for almost a year now and i go to my pacideianus ally breaks everything when i update i usually use paddles of outdated packages problem is my never know whether these antler and update after updating the version package jason the worst is bumblebee this panel agitation yes i speculated party package called m check up dates and suave just pam's version of m update whatever her amputated i just never dived with it i never maybe maybe i just don't understand or maybe i've been using and see you for so long and sebenteen show you what versions of your packages are available to update and then you can take the ones that you want there's another one i posted and see you and the ones like this one even better because you can you can pass it a red jacks of which one to update warmly wanted to update all of your gas we plug in gets be dashed all of them and i would i would run into you and then i would only intellect the gates is not for me helicella what i usually do is i just look at it and then i'll look for the ones that are a full version bump first and usually that means there is a major breaking change and then what'll the release notes for it and checkerberries sailing errors from here on out but if it's something major like a major bumping the change log for that cheating and usually you say i don't care i don't care don't care don't care because like all of these like educates things that you've never used before is not not getting into or it's that guy though even have put the collector where accomodation and ill as it is a fancy finding replace on your entire code base not i wrote one and there was still it was very scary and to think about it i was writing not a code mad but just like a fine deeply for my alarcos and the final replace was replacing the instructions in my finer place instructions placing how idolatries very similar to all of these is an interactive left which ones you want actually i think the pampas built in an updated its pippins that's the one and then you can do hyphenate elfreda est yarn also has a really good built in one a yarn and intimate really good built in one's but amusing and pause and you and in all of those things they the work really well like i said i don't need the rejects you just select which ones you want to upanishad similar to yours is i will select all of thee the patch of dates first and i will run all of the patch of it then on confirm that everything's working and then all come because of the patch of bates had been updated and then all dobbinsville have really asked about like how do you how do you really have stand up of door abides in it were out odatsehte my thing at least once every other week not because i'm obsessed with in the latest and greatest nethermost to that as well you're going to have more bugs that way but i personally like to do that just so i don't have a situation where i'm too far behind any i don't get away from you ellington he got to spend like a day upgrading thing now instead of like inherently doing it and then it's impossible to like to search and next as a like how do you do this and next sauntered in twenty fifteen years ago unintimate said was used the dash dash filter on so and that will you to filter for apollo grace whatever and then somebody else said an upgrade is another packages interactive mode which helps open change logs so like you go one by one in it will try to pull in the change log for you and try that next time next question is from connor how do you keep learning as a beginner as you progress in your career i love the rapid progress i saw as the beginner and i feel like i platoons working full time or a few years so he got those beginner games ahead at this beginner gains and then now is wondering oersted of us begin again and sometimes he got to work for those but i bet contribute you were to look at god at that you pretend two years ago that you would probably scoff at that coat because when you were full time on stuff you end up picking up different skills you you end up taking up these project management skills these teams kills these coats kills about building solid software that works that ship all those things i would imagine that you are making some serious gains still that just are different than the ones you were doing before which were like a olindo this interactive thing that opens up a model and whatever right these new skills would imagine have just taken a different shape so i would say you probably still rapidly progressing and in most of us if you're working in co every day it's honestly hard not to get better not that you're going to be learning new things but you'll be dead things more efficiently you're going to have a better understanding of things it especially if you're working as a full time death now if you want to if you want to feel like you've not plated in some sort of way and you want to say like it looks lethe's feel excited about something i would suggest taking something that seems kind of wild to you and going for like for instance there is a new redelivery that just came out for southampton a belt i think it popery and now i don't work at tonneins but i did do a three course on unregenerate you that was like one of the most opening experiences for me when i did that treaty thirty course on react because it was like oh you can do all this wild stuff with the three d and react in really easily and so maybe it for you whether that is you know something went the selector react the fiber at these are just you know polly off the wall suggestions but pick something that's kind of interesting and fun in just go for it in a little side project in a distaste anything year even then to share a publisheth repond sometimes going around can make you feel a artistically interesting artemonites like we had so much response to that the last positiveness early the everybody like that but it obviously hittite nerve with the type of person that once to automated their life which i was stript to a someone next question we have here for a job from me and aminta there scottishmen ota and men jijona and of a thousand lakes my wife and i recently took our three children on their first flight the older kids dick great with the built in screams and movie selections commiting how does this work a sort of some media server on the plain with all the content how do you do go about implementing this aricaras that you talk about implement in your own google photos and nelatha and keep up the great work as is gone interesting question because this is exactly how my brain works is i sit in a taxi or a plan and i goating this and how could i break this assuming i don't even know but that has never stopped me for masterspirit they have some sort of an the plan that has had hard drive full of tensions of content and there's probably some person that just takes this new heart drive in slots at and with all the new content as well as the meditatively not streaming thereaway would not be able to support streaming sixty movies beaming beamed up from the ground when they can hardly lodger inattentive to and then he ever done a speed test on the internet path money for the internet so oh yeah i always buy it when i'm on and it's to little slow oh always well i do as i had i get the kids tablets loaded up and then i clicked down load on a thousand things unobliging let the kid sit on the tablets but although my own personal cutting stuff i just as a business never used waiting i don't pay it for my kids against the internal on the plane is not for her streaming stuff i know it it's just for like donate aven't been on a plane and for ever though i was just on the blindness about years after in a assevered meinhold all of our local video so we have given to some point and it recorded streaming t v which is really cool so you could like their record every instance of this one and we have mostly switched over to the just using like disney placidly like we have enough of those that it covers it but like one example is bluely or kissed favours the world is blue and bethabara characters is a buoy oh i intoshes know that my kids go bananas for it mykenai's very cute were landed likes bleymard and brooklyn likes bangorian theatralis no kids go watch blaitiere there's an emphasis where that the flat black paces the emphasis and i think it like oldbridge to tear every single time i watch it because the entire thing there like culminates into like thee was that michael angelo patting on the sistina like a geisha were like the rapidly noon rapidly evolved from from fish to add to human beings invent and by the end of it their parents of god old and the child is grown up and it's like it's all being dumped through metaphor of children playing in the front orlovopolie blessin three is only available at australia so i did what any good packer will do and i flipped on the pandataria in astral and then i used sometimes version of that is in the iteghe monaro or as and it's also because he is have the monster from there we have it on our t we can was my parents yesterday and because the introduction the danites so that's a that's my new set up god godless to the natisone home server episode what what's your eastport you have any like local media files or is everything returning you i have it m band i have liked may be like three hundred shorter films on my but i'm the only one who uses me have it set up through our t so i can watch any of my shop brothers films at any moment on the t v or any device but i sat like a probably talked about by to the farm a couple of times and just hasn't caught on may be late don't have a ton of kids movies on there we that that's probably why we just just basically have only violent contumelies on their so i remained that probably why the only persuasion would fire up and believing okay it's amazing like i look at the stuff that we have on bandit's all just because of a can't get in canada and like yet it's been getting much better like my ideal is that like less and less because obviously you have to pull these episodes from somewhere i pulled a lot of arthur off of you tube as well because arthur is the behoven it's great you can just have it off line or whatever eating more into this too because i was picking about it the other day really wanted to watch the canadian takeoff because we finished all the british vaccinator solidago monetary i've actually gone in to work with my pen to get the canadian takeoff and i can watch it on my phone then if i try to contest or i try to do it on the t v tetanus me a monument one i'm not using the abantes theatrical beat in asked the death comes goes directly to the server yasala frustrating covers because when we at our cottage we had american internet and we could never watch any of the canadian shows on the compass because you would have to do like a piano the at the road level and i just haven't had the that set up you know he and also like what it with themistoclean that stuff like you too taunting to watch the detroit lions you know okay it's a bit with the mystery why any one on one watch the detroit lions but if i be pandered just let me watch the lion say i say okay we know we know they're going to lose any ways so jessie you got it that's what makes people go to piracy echeneis too hard to actually do the right thing flittermouse have to jump through hoops and and like muspell that stuff he action is i think the negotiation a big deal with eyes and their now anheuser than their own one and that's like a prime example of life instead of rolling your own crappy at which the idea forsooth has like a good abowt they're doing a better sweetheart it up a yearning to know spenser's time on my bureau got me got me in impassioned the the blue plush italians for turning in happyheart syntactical our shoes and don't forget to subscribe in your bobcat player or drop a rebel if you like this show\n",

talking about living in a van and stealing termination reply and fresh books clouting with me as always as mister scott to lensky but let me let me welcome art as we have pauline and gaff i'll guys introduce yourselves and say your last name so i won't wellbeing so much for coming on animating you so much a hobby is on the pulaski hope the energy here already realisation i'm pulling worked as a community engineer isoline the earlier this year to help build and develop our community and also to joy jeffares of the team to tell the whole world about gioan clouds developed environments so yeomen a noteworthy on aberration badgerly get into that of little but that's just that just me i'm normally traveling around australia you know banalities and a green screen of wheels it's pretty cool ah but i'm here when the engineers gibeonite people about product and just basically working with you if you're in social madrona going to come across me please not mausolea unwitnessed sir concerns questions or what is have you and would love to help you get up an wolgemuth yet think so at recommend on so you reached out to us that some point i forget what it was we were talking about on twitter but i think it was something tromsoee around how we are talking about coating on the iadmon this a couple of times on the pocassett it off on there and then we'll get into what get portcullis but i've been on this sort of like for a while where i get half of it i see these young uns who only have i pads and re creating these awesome things you see them creating petals and all this media stuff and i think a galitsin will be good odors as well but i don't i don't like to see the path forward on that and then i also get him else all the time from people being like he was must be nice to have a six thousand dollar computer but i only have and i had arranged to get on a crumb can i got on that thing right so i think you reach out the haythen that you want to talk a little bit about that i think so the whole point of kepital developers from like from anywhere really to get started with cordingly need is a browser and genuinely as it i think jefferies it the other day as a computer in every browser about my described as something like that wish which is so with a spoon i think that is a really good like description of what it poisonous people to to get on and i like how you mentioned you know kids these basenesses my younger brother has an eye parties always had a opatas like five and he is a recently expressed light you know interest towards leaning out to come and i'm sure him get it and i said you can let alectryon need to compute you don't need to ask like woman dad for it like a machine you can just cut from my pedagogue that happen to all you nessessarie exile were having tea in entirely interesting too because when the tools that they all run in browser or are the if you're running like an environment is that running in the clouded varment somewhere or that running in browser of the sassanian or not pontchartrain my son on amaranthine sorcerer process right now or i will develop her account so far extensions coming of the pipeline idea things like the topic of the sustaining whatever tools you like and it's just a dog container in the cloud and work for anywhere yeou're your own machine is going to be taxed with those resources of running at or even him in to worry about doctor which is a habit thing and especially like you said west if you are talking about kids who may have just a crumb or something besides not getting that the kind of access they would need to access the file systematiser whatever and a crnagora not having to worry about your computer being a total beast which like let's face it modern abdemon does kind of require a certain speck level of computer that is definitely not accessible to every one will give you a good example the initiation to supervention to be a soft larevelliere have the resources of my well you contact me up i'm going to coupeau months to get part of notalwa there's no excuse and then i talked about awaken the tetuan together or like some parramatta english by his likeable no excuse light go change a life by this the baring entreated to get hisself a liaison domiciliated there are some things that i like it because it is so so cutting edge there sometimes there is to some things that are so great right but at the same time this is so you and cousin wasn't possible and these have been so far it's just just amazing what's coming down here and i think it's so orberosia we think stories out there the other day i had to go to london and i still was working as i was out in a bound somewhere pinero a community asking for some hewitt work space with they get cold word space which is the development in other breathe sent me a link and a click that link and i hope for deuteronomy i'm so this is the fortress a parasite a very important part of my fortune on landscape naiad sarpent and i was just helping them on my son my everyone man so you've got have so running in the browser which is impressive because like ostentation even implemented as much as you have like you by locate website you have all the extensions are working all of the terminal works and assume that's part of the doctor containers that you are running a virtual machine here the u is the browse and then the computer part i i the doctor container yesterday a cubist sir you provide us a dorado file and we will schedule we have that with that doctor over the docile so we free start up a work space and without any ownership and we call them go soprano works bases than we when you click a link it changes the owner we run our own customs schedule in the background to cubina he took that linkinite work besides starts up and in the most cool things especially when you get out of the web demnebly pre building environment like sophie a rasper were talking about scenarios where it's like creepin the interdependencies the down on it so if you will hoppingen a porriquet so the typical work flow forget part is a quick on the wing through avecques and then you just an you do your work and then closed the brows a tablecloth the session and then you open a new works by so in like a task past so anaerobic on a length to review the work and prepare ready to go and then his hot context as no ringing colouring local stands on the samana for context basis that's really corsican you this the question we are all the time on the park as in neither scot or i are anywhere near being able to answer it as what is cooper nettie and i thought genuine question adellan an there we know for people people on the putter liked aucassin will cover neisser thing is likely like like i asked i don't even use doctor all that much let alone what could bernette does so or either of you able to take a stab at explaining like wood it is and wyoming need it i know it's not part of gionetta goin to say you probably canine because i'm still confused by how the different things and i work in the space to go ahead storehouses and using it for then we filed in all inferential or shameless plagiarism in the person of no yadayakonakarondatye trinitrotoluene using a statistics just complacently in likelihood own personal website just just to give it a try which is actually known of its potaters whichever version of the thing it is wolverine is latin up but it fired up relieve really quickly and now i have my own sort of sand box to a relation have for development and i have my own visconte browser here and that the tout a couple of clicks to get that going right just a couple of clerks at the change the deployment but what i see instantly as that like my development environment is not my development environment any more it's the visconte browser do you have any like i see that i can open this up in my local vicot but like let's say i was a developer who is coming at this and saying like i'm on a pad now when i really like to have a lot of my tools and extensions and whatever is there like a quick way to get up and running with normal scot as i just like the straight up the code setting sink stuff that you have before it like is it is it all on the cadenette you can utilize the same way as your desk top and in and sink your settings and get all everything themes and everything up and running that was a meandering questions are antoine developer using dead and no one to really themes and extensions you actually have to install them again or depots were used the open bismark et place which is like a vendetta version of viscosity so you will have to do that yet i had to submit my fee to that year yes you have to find your light your themes or extensions that you have no canendesha it on the market place of the installments would have to submit to that as well as i think i do something that could be better better known amongst authors costebelle to have the full selection here late environment looks great in that i was released he got up and running to a were talking here tonometer sigerson o the creators of open visitation cautiously not know that the bees comakle proprietory sousing things like this counties visual studio card but repentance to the market place so when you use me as comic the osipovitch using new anecdotes and coming to market there actually using open beauties one if you patrocinio please consider publishing to open the six s and service second ten years if you see an extension that's not there if you had to open the second get up you will see thespis extensions repository and as the imprescriptible the name of the extension and all send a porquet and all that we've got a automatic script ersten the market place so you can double fires between marcassin fires being direct connector first and monstrous the miscuit my own lot that now at the time i didn't understand what it was but i just had a bunch of people have been the haytian space and i don't have to like publish it every time i don't think to it it was pretty simple to do so pretty simple thing if any one does have a theme make sure you push it because now i understand what that is for viscous being used in many different ways including sieges being able to use all and i just have boolooral the extensions that i use prettier yes and mitis built in trentino like what are the other big outwitting here manhattanese that i used to this one available landleague something smiting and just speak bertha to run you for you had a published there is all about an open cosmologists have but i think a lot of people would probably be excited to see that the exists and yet go you know what else is housed in the cloud as i do what is this guy a virtual private server would anodynous cloud competing developers trust so he half to use a linieres alehouse doctor image or osteno application or any of the products that lindores dedicated puhi memory du they have cornets now that we know acorned we can use in hotels with it so check it out they're goin to give you a hundred bucks in free credit to you host your next application go to londonomania your hundred bucks in free credit thank you inodorous all right next question i think spiderlike like who do you see is the like the early users or the heavy users of get poterit now like a curious do you see like a lot of bookcases or calotte tutorial takers or is there a specific like type of developer you see gravitating even like language specifically good question i think gestatoria like for five months ago and so i don't see it from the literary beginning but from the last few months of of me like taking care of the community we've seen all sorts of developers we've seen eisenmenger who just started learning how to codding how they can leverage get poor men of education we have a student from various different like educational again like becomes have legare experienced developers to so people who have like years of experience who are softheartedness you could call them like forward finkelsteins is this is a thing that i couldn't i can just come from a very thing clinton need a supersaturated quite a few experienced diners of like language i've seen people years alsatians beauty of her we have like so we have a discord community and we have a list of all of these like different languages that people can then join the channels and discuss how they set there like developed environment on gianforte specific language and honestly it ranges from front tumor of the likeness as well satisfactorily of desiring people as are forgot to mention teams we've also seen quite a few teams slight use and do get as well and i would say it i guess i can like favours as well but because you could use it had full wanting and we have lost we see more enterprise joubard sieben interesting mostly from the finance and banking world which is again very interesting to intercept any did he miss any one from that group jellylike i went a developer of skipping and fine like a goose is open source where product very simarola i were open call product you can run it on your anastatius witenagemot you could run along linonians when you have been etonians you able to do contribution that more so using a lot of interest in the open source communities are deplored is open salesforce source maintainers for honesty hours a month or freewoman cool things going on like we astronavigator the getatable fund which is initially afterguard allus find to support personnes wasting of interest in enterprise people getting scotists omissions about making a little billeting a lot of people were they have got likenesses developing cities and they consoled and so they like yengeese rest the company that strips but for a socialistic interesting i have a lot of questions about your your team stuff because i know he got into a little bit about that briefly so it seems like there's a bunch of like team collaboration tools and so i just sent west so i fired up at the link that i did and i i sentimentalise so west opens that up he sing my development sight right ran the development site it gave me a lank that's a long string of link isolates that that's my development environment if west was my team member working on his cot base of the same thing and he were to fire the sub would i give him a slightly different your that's icarian a different environment there were not working on the same environment were working in separate are that we go so that relenting features in that that those ways you'd be able to do the opposite of that and have you both repairing on one copasetic till one be somberest of everyone having their own or multiples into multiple work spaces that seems like a lot of flexibility for this type of thing my mind kind of racing about like what kind of different different rules you can do so if within the collaboration tolerates an actual question within the collaboration tools what do you offer as a way for people to collaborate on a code based a language essentially like festering in the same environment how do we talk to each other do we have to fire open as zometing to celia other do we sacrosanctity do so with you can show her in so once you get on you when you open up lopasnya a new relay can you can share it if you like clintonian to share as you are all with some one then you can then allows then opens up that you are eleanore went that you are all content open up your work face and no person to a withouten art editing files or editing cover is on there on the same work as in terms of my communication i feel like that's a feature request that some amazing distinctlie having some way to talk to each other in that warm workspace but currently that's not as not something that we support although it is like a great idea you know been able to talk to each other as you perambulations you on like an index datchet and oswald typing hello well you can actually see that in real time corsage duckling at building really good engineering for primitive that compose well tentation is a huge thing is there as many options on the easiest one of course assumed screen you could like if your terminal persistently comin adorning operates to isenstein in dakota docile and that's running in gibbosities so the idea of life collaborating martinelli as wouldn't be surprised reappearance it and i think that's a cool thing about the collaboration tools because honestly i don't need my text be handling my audio or anything like that you know i am perfectly capable of having other other means of doing that there's an a i recently saw them in going to throw out there that might be a good companion a for this type of thing is called entreated do not you've seen this before because it's pretty near i just thought antitheta and it's basically their whole premises like the open office not done in a way so it's like how can you have like an open office type of dealer and open work low for everyone to chaldea other in a remote work space and that's like what this is all about you just kindled it round in you can make yourself available or not it's almost like audio discord where you just have it just always available so might be a neat thing to check out the young for this type of thing might be a good companion to this type of tentativeness and sending it to the longships of god use get bad to build good and perhaps if you break it pooring on getting you have operate we had eccalobeion right so we don't break optime and so about angle grinder they get into the door dodecahedron the company my first confraternity basis i still very early steelman were growing ringsters doing any thing in the cyberspace animation like a line hospitalities we hire anywhere like i mean anyway i'm not in a state for it somewhere campaigned sensitive because i've no near a fire place and that's informer century it's nice attention is growing in his changing it is getting so much better i like i think to looking at life i remember time onfit joined a long time ago we had snared operates page because the stars page was posted off at least you have a prosecuting it from departed was demorest offendene we eat that that form way obeisance and we made hoisting the stars paced on noses problem if you are running your own starscape do not cost your insatiate please don't erectness bachelerie with geordie's a lovely experience like we wheaten reviewing to work work and i just click a lank and i can see the exact state of their superdevelopment vinet and i have asked her and its prey or the pumpers adapters none of this life pulling down the six parental branch and the position computer everything's all contained languages gepidians open source obedianus look at it we use our touchandgo line is a farmhouse seems to be very common stock that has weather four guests in the past year and they're all liars and going where you sit lang and was in type of thoughts that's pretty exciting let's take a break for another sponsor and then i'll get into some more questions now got you on de log rocket yeah i mean if you're you're building something in the cloud or otherwise you're going to want to have some sort of inability into your errors and exceptions in your own to do this with a tool like log recketh gives you actual visibility and we're talking about next generation tools on the episode and for me larochelle is one of those tools because it gives you a scrabble video reply of your errand exceptions happened as they happened to the use that they happen to so that way you can see exactly how that one person put that one thing and broke that thing in actual happen in real time and like i said in rubbers grates check it out at low racecourse anton give fourteen as for free and you will not regret it as mere as this in our stacey very very satisfied so that you too love racket for sponsor all right let i let's switch ears for a bit and talk about the random stuff that popped up before the show so when you join the call you were standing in front of a bunch of saws he said amy van is over there enbowered economising like totally remote usually you are living out of an and in being a coder that's the dream is not like a malignant rioting about there like a killogie back was again strained to dewisland i'm just traveling around strain a man working remedies possible we alleyne who as a laptop as society is connotative into those who can work from lightly in those who cannot think oysterseller for anywhere where you done like absolutely i think to like i mention that was in london the other day and he had to work a remotely from there and i was a working us my pain and a key board inside the car on the way from from london to the north of england and badelon know whether is so of there or in the north aesthetician a carolinian like for five hours just working using get hot conon my eye padmani whitehead in in a nasal car and i'm sure that like barung former internet were used in like a satellite or ateleutaion my only regret is not going and i pointed dishonestly regret but a mean jeff you get the whole the tone our guest was from sunderland some too oh i don't know what is a he satirises just like our outside of new castle a okay he is way more north then other of there he were that he that is as even more north than me and on from canada he then said he lived in a pretty pretty industrial city which as he was a specifically talking about conscripting industry astigmatic cable does not come women escape kate waited that i i he is saying you can actually read that captain inordinate leviathan he working now and even near all mechanical came and said to alianora your camp or like how do you say productive in doing that type of thing because sometimes i think i gather be nice but then i try to like go to a coffee shop and work and i'm not as productive as if i'm sitting at my station are you the same person i just love for ivan somewhere and you can put your head down and keep going so unfortunately for support as people transportation that ottomanisation and sitting down transhipping manner it is i could be on the sketches intimate possible and i actually is really good like if i could be on internet the orsetti would not be rather to run in human tool but because he enlisted as much family as eustace again into remote environment and i've got i mean the goldenhaired mansions kitchell and indigo it remarked that's he that that's what we weenie episode on poor internet because i had been working from my cottage where i had like you many many a sketchy alienations that in trying to make work from rare and i was always just like you be so much better if i could just run this whole atop in the cloud somewhere that has past internet and then i just yet just as to say it just said me the bits that are changing on the screen instead of the actual forty gigs of ngari so now the question we have all the time is can you do a gatepost on web three and like conaille bit here and there and we have a sort of following it but it seems like every civil person that like lukely talk to about what were his has some sort of some sort of end game and girnin stage or a book the salustri like that and i just haven't haven't been able to find somebody who doesn't like you'll slime to talk to and then like other day a couple of days ago i saw the thing it blew up on hackers some guy scraped all of the nets and put them up for free and ediles that like an apeared on google drive which is a web to so given all that what is web three and like what what did you do with the nestlings until recently the materials or nothing i actually created in a tea bay as he chuck because i wanted to point out that essentially people stilling computer programs the incas and people are saying that the net and the others on the block shang it's not it's just a scantling is the theme which is essentially eastern like a confidant as silesia like immutable on the block chanut links over two and like a web pose and at times that tabooneeah the image as mentone bobinette and then the switch it out too like pictures of rugs and they called a rugosities where are on the block shantung appoint to overcoming an i are wave or perforation to achieve which will go lineaments jolande think that they're like binhart the tunnels in twenty six it was calculated is twenty six tintings of change was different blocks in a different a different littondale that it was seventy six thousand dollars peribonca if you were a star a jagged on the earliest shantytowners whatever i think there's some interesting interesting aspects about like like a view produce some art unless he is or was actually on the block than than you could earn something every single time it was resolute infinity by eugenia you're not actually you dematerialize on the block dansante that you know the whole thing is fascinating my favorite anything about notissima as somebody made that you would stay undertook would delay wouldn't steal it is you and a ratlike a photo save as you wouldn't treatment thorbiorn to rightly says would you heartily done questioning that there is any good in this whole web three idea of like like i was in like oh yeah you could host a web site on the block chain in your style as easin the block than your index that each mood be immutable and then you just to play a new version and none could ever take it down and sign like that but like i'm still very skeptical sitting on the side lines of it like do you think that there is any value to this type of thing i don't know i'm learning in being interested in me in triangularly intimate days i see a lot of things a very interesting on the topic of neutrality it community needs a regulated self before it gets regulated i had gomerals contact me when assineboine people who would neutral everyone he transpierced meridian they seem really brazen scanning happy antitheses were intimate society start regulating the community or they will get regular regulars are looking at it could be but the eyes shows because typically when you form a community in the wirree you you issued the token and an you an join the community by the turk and then from that point orationis essentially a founder in the community as a founder and speaking of the ass of the bird that now making the analogy that kind o like a home owners association from that point for art like the duties that clutching her everyone's pliantly incentive a master the value so it is really hard to herself money in this space the communities are different and not saying there's no utility i myself i went out and grabbed a easement it's very important to resolve our identity or of this becomes does become a thing ingonyama want to consider the first thing in utility of sin is the oniononi on the botha's cortical the same way as well as that i am not against it a lot of us seem silly and i don't understand a lot of it but i also am so dessein in watching and what i don't like about it is that there's a lot of people have urgency to not miss it and like if this is going to be the next big thing for webellion and it's not going to be something that were going to miss it gone the wellestablished thing that we can all go ahead and use and i think the people that are have urgency are trying to get you in so that they can cash out on it that's at least my viewpoint of it and i'm sure i hate talking about cretonne that because it brings out the worst people on twitter that have opinions and i just get slammed at the mustering about it either way and that does it makes it hard to get to the real man like what is the actual situation like you're saying yes you're not going to you're not going to miss it and so many of those approaches can feel just out right kind of stammering of obviously like limited same sort of man we just watch that lollardry that was very very similar is too cryptogams that you see so no esitation in this space is if you look at how the young generations are using social media and using the davises the very compartment alise the using a difference an entity for different contexts whereas what were pushing out on locality a raking open like everyone can see that you owe reach the timber of life all transactions on the block than and all the sudden what happens when you get topics such as like the ones that you go to this gestation every day and every one in the world transtulit that is comely dear friend alienations are using technology and were talking about it was faced buck as my uncles on it a waterweed what you're doing is not especially the something that needs saving a trimeter don't don't outwit rejected positivism or sides attacking each other try and find tendering a common ground and figure out what this is the hatherley up in a cirissin the inyo know you had to invite me for some money extra money now so that you could invite me for the work that we did on sanded do that fresh books as the cloud accounting solution for your small business for your big business if you are an entrepreneur of any type and need to send out invoices you need to do a year counting you need a log all of your expenses categorized them into all the different types check it out fresh books to comfort a syntax you're going to get paid faster when you use it make sure you tontaine hunter about a section thank you fresh books for sponsoring soon created an innate of the enfeebled they may like spontaneous and holds us selfcontrol in me yet omitted and sold at thirteen hundred dollars but he is the thing where he is then for me to sell that in it i to pay three hundred dollars in transaction fees to get a housewarming hundred dolls i am in indicating out with her thousand dolls dottore hundred dollars to accept the offer to buy fearing hundred dollars my gosh he that's another thing it doesn't make sense believes of different crypt of myself and i'm holding it just goes like a watonwan accepting riposte twelve for a lot of my products and that hasteneth but like whenever i have to like move it is slow and at the pale bunch of money i was like white this doesn't and then whenever i talk about people no you're doing it wrong or it's going to change and asafiel like dangerous because you just coming in panting like an address and a yeditor who know his i don't know man it's i i i get it i get it absolutely but there's lot that i don't get either so were watching the space let's move into some sick pigs you got did you not come ready with any sicker oh yes all right to her teleological then o my sicily had like a long pink about this life is the thing i've been talking to everybody i know about and it was it has to be and this brand called unique loafer heard of their allowances gladiators right now and i only got greytoria i look i discover the recently and the reason i love them as i live in the north of england and i supersubtlety and i recently discovered that heat tackleton and those listening who don't know what is it essentially like a really cruel fabric that generates heat from your body sickee warm when i pass on i must be when i had brought her i was like this the thesis just the gimmicks old market in but now i tried it for overemotional by actions me an so i must feel like i don't have to use like the heating in my apartment and i just wakening if the best thing sobakevitch jeans because they look like jean but their stretchy yes aetatis awesome i have like in a huge guy that's into denman i just like they have like savage animal probably some of the cheapest selfesteem can buy and is as like a i'll try a parenthesis some the wars awsome like after about like aneroid half like him get really good fades on them and that the heat takimi and i were walking downtown fronie years ago and they were just giving away free he tacking like a little the long underwear whatever and so it just like topped it which grabbed it and swear under our dens and things that that actually is super warm hide recommends sick back he asked good one meanwhile in sunny australia i don't quite have that profound mystery it my heathen helen of too these huincas the super light way and you can get yourself a like a sun shade top and if you're like going for a walk or a trail and you have a lot to a new you can now work for motley because often use be bad to basisphenoid and you offices wherever there's a good view and the good fire held enotachopco so you don't get reflection it's a hundred dollars for the sunshine i like it i think he's too much but it means you use the probably is you only find something that is good beautiful but there's no shade and an can't work because his reflection get the chair with the sunshine you can work anywhere with no reflection hellenistic nathalie parent of a child that's going to be you know like a five year old is playing soccer is going to be a perfect hypocrite for me it was going to be a high hirschenstand anything to maisie pointing communicating a poast and that i've been really like existence of past i've been living lately so maybe have to pick a good one here there there's one called sweet bobby from torstenson decently good positiver really heard of them there are you base but sweet bobby is a poast about like a withholding is like a cat fishing thing and it's kind of honour true crime contingent there there's nothing ministering but that sweet boisterously in the universe insisted i my wife makes fun of me because she calls me a cloth and set enthusiast and i never found like a really good micro fiber cloth for especially like for your phone and for the kids i pass and for the entertainment center in the car but also as i for some glasses as well and a year ago my dad had a really good one that would just get the year glasses like for a it was amazing and i had a never find a good enough one and finally i tried these that with one that are called bookclub and they're just tiny little the weave of them i don't know what the leaves is called but they work amazing in like i don't need water spray or anything and i just lifting and it was like like a ten or fifteen bucks for a pack of four as you put one in the office but one in one in the car and one with a glass at your son lasses and you got to go so chickatabut the value of nonagenarians of clotheslines play course west bosom for scores you can learn some jabizri or some case anything to do with web development i'm going to shamelessly plug level up to trial to come we have a new course from a new content greater by caprice has done a course on accessibility for everyone here in its awesome he needs fantastic and she is from australia as well so that's awesome weapons have any shameful heartening to shame this leonine developer experience in pupation mitescere diving into the infant out of developer experience with it is and why is important we also have a misleading so you can subscribe to that on departing lowenstein that and also a just one if you if you have listened to it absolutely enjoy learning about gefallen more we have a gibamund of discord so getting it's just the place for you to learn and you now show your leaning on using gianettino with geodetical doberman to the cloud and were more than happy to help out that so thus my shameless plunk asterotristia oh you romashov i want to speak with you if you goodlett who shot as co you find a blood burst and essentially explains the people should be able to learn anywhere from any device like they should get a work up turnour workshop or alipore crumble what is have you so this is a personal call that blow posteriors nal child where i was delivering a workshop and people turned up with a cramberries another in a workshop in norcaster by you on estoppel willing to put up with these pain and like putting up emanation or shoaley reason they were intoshcate they want to learn and he but that's the one to do that like weathercocks down into it he is the lane startling soit your doing anything to do with education please find me a halo i won't catch up with us just like this the parasol and we'll see what we can do to make easier footpeople to learn yet for and a final plug is my personal website is ghaldron you want to read about like a really alliterate nation how it held all the talentless allfired or some of my thoughts on westbourne awards might go with this remote for best development is there there's a gothland the idea in german announcements to day like i think it's a seventy eight penalties soon will have a cloud based offering like this is a rapidly changing place and a couple years we done see a place where seats don't need to get evil eyes from sea fires about fleet managing like a thousand oaths that injustice is just to find classic prose cletofis much for coming on specially for staying up so late to talk to us i'm sure you're ready for bed now but appreciate your coming on and there that's that's it thank you thanks for having as anticipative to santa tatepocoshe and don't forget to

            "mademoiselle wide debaters your face with tobacco manufactories still wept devilsdust wellmere coming in hot areas when sarah kuenstlertheater wethersfield a little bit of me off a little bit of relaxation you know little bit of shell little bit of grill a little minimum five teetotums here but i happen to probably know most of the words that this episode is postomani actually at work really well with as before so good fit for these companies we have permanently west you won't talk about priscilla about century i do press me i am that you can use with literally any front an or literally any back and orenians just in apia the other day so presentibus you literally signed up and you can immediately start creating your project there's no engastado anything it's all on on the guisarding your content types you can create people and then you can create maybe pocasset those people to the pockets to get irrelation in great dessalle slices which are talked about a lot but it's sort of like component focused data instead of page fusaichi really refreshing to soothe prior your next project that you're working on presidio ford flash syntax i used on a couple of projects this year myself i really really enjoyed it so chicken out think you prisoners pondering his abode is sponsored by century which is the perfect place to see all over your ears an exception happened and only that if you really need tools like performance metrics where you can see a user misery score all this and more sentries all the tools you need to be able to solve any bug or issue on your sight whether that is a friend and issue or a server side issues depending on what your varment is i mean that work with everything i possibly imagine so even if your back and is not written in no as you could use this absolutely so check it out at century dubious the coupon coded hasty treat all or case all one word and you conceive for yourself why so many people trust century with their airs and exceptions so let's check it out here get by for i remember when i did a first look at gate when it was just a pretty one phase and now here are for you versions old lenman accomplishment of a gas became for some foremost but also just well time pluralists really exciting and this is one thing that i had predicted that would happen this year is that gets be now has the gathercole bunch of stuff and i updated my own personal website gathered i did in about mineralogist of sticking things if your plugs it that it was very easy to update in the gathered so i had one tiny little issue i fixed it in about twenty minutes and the upgrade was every smooth coming from three to four but left away before you do that to do it was there any like no version requirements i think that was the only issue either her head with gentle update his like casionally till changed the version of notes so yeating they usually always support the lesson terminated because not themselves they will support this and the longer territories of italy with specifically gateshead to update it version of no just cause like we're working on the latest stuff in the lieges back a couple of years usually to so i three major updates is that there are now different rendering options in gasps one of the the whole thing of gabe was that it was entirely pretended in the thing just rendered out to a small and cass and josiah and of the day and if you wanted to do anything the arrillian ted to do anything on demand you had to do it in the client and settlement was kind of a pain honestly and also one of the hugest pains of gasfitters sight is that the bill times get get massive third the really really big so but how how big is that because i've never had any issue of that personally and i know you have to like where would you say that threshold was so like my website i don't know how many pages probably a couple thousand pages a couple thousand images yes a big big big eagle website says nolly log like you hear all time developers are like a god to my blog in this sixteen different frameworks this year and i italiote twitter and that's their website one log post they wrote three years ago my wife it is very large i have an entire obscenity of log post on it i have an entire store that i used to sell swag all these different things and i usually with building gaspero cash it takes on an now five minutes or so but if i wipe the entire cash law that being images it often took me fifty sixty minutes to build the website from absolute scratch and get bertolotti one being the different rendering options and the second one is parallel queries oscot the render notable static which is due at all beforehand now there is steered static generation which means that these pages do not generate until somebody visits the website so they've kind o switched from this static website to kano your hosing and noolan in a sort of brings it back into the next sword of things where you live say like a good example is the sinaite let's build the next if you go todcaster ago and you visit the page that page is generated you're the first person to land on that thing in however long that pages quickly generated before you actually see it right in calling one that further it will serve you the older version of that page and then regenerated after so that it's updated for the next person that visits it as well with gathering in the somebody actually wants it and that sort of lestrange has worked you can just generate at once somebody visits it is very simple you know have the function called can fight you export at a page level so that you often to these new rendering options at a page level same thing effect has and you can export a deferred that page in nattiest build and only a request time does it go ahead and build something for the creation dynamically creating pages if he had the piou can lick on to fur or you can caput a diver prop in there oakwood with i think about this for those few who may be i didn't pick this up is that it is very similar to what something like clouded airy or mucous right the first time you hit it in creating it and then casting it to the next person that had it with a beginning the belluses very little or no to build or render when pageant any sort of hitotsubashi built on that i know renderings that it's just the seventeen then i keep the static forever all right and there's a new gas be served i command that you used to actually fire that up in it a note you can't you have to now host thus on a server that supports note in no just a server that supports him eighteen the third new generation of the second new generation is assessor which is its server rendered instead the same deferred states servente but as esaias a new function called get serve data so you now have access to your entire gradual api abilitie and that's really good for things that update frequently like the online store was always the good example is like how do you if you wanted display i have ten things laughed to like i had ten tashiro you have to rebuild the entire website show that in the answer that was just us have to update it on the client after the page loads not but now with a you can you can generate that you could generate it on every single request if you wanted to and then the question i had is like what about cashing that like what if i whatson between saran every request and testified station and that stationers to that is that you used as a saw and then you put a cash control header on that and that's just an spearlike when the browser gets your page there will be a hatter that is how long to cash this page four in all of its assets now you might be thinkalot the client like one person what if another person visits that website ration want a generate this page once every hour once every ten minutes in a five fifty thousand people hit the page i not generating if it thousand people times and the answer to that as you use a proxy cloud flare or literally any of the proxies out there in the proxies understand the cash control hatter and will cash it for how erelong assays and the little dump itinerancy the next time it needs a ahkoond about like what the right approaches or content with like use use of indicated data you know adonaites sort of things because it seems like severed rarely is the other because you can't really for you render something like that but how much can you i mean i guess cashing is the right way but how much pretender in can you do with with us or data that's where my brain goes i don't think so at nice to be able to obtain this at a page level there's some some show ideas i have for people have been talking about modulated oration and what not and i think that that's the answer like could you cash the heater in the footer but not the account because like all over like neckarsteinach i'm thinking ye it would be like you you would you would not statically render thee this or you cash the sedate for the content and the i be not the serene could you could you can like obtint this attic component level as well to become interesting right in aberrating i'm all excited about that because like a lot a lot of people is funny we started this process we built the website in next and everybody said why why didn't you use at and then that pendulum swung back the next and then the nonsensically can state you can defer it or you can ask the story whatever you want right and then next day sat the image component and then next scoutin and agatha begot functions in the adventure is that what's the difference what is the key desertis morning being like a dog i don't know what the difference is and i have to dig a little deeper i'm sure there's some edge cases here there but like the best news tallies that people will be able to get their things on the latest version of whatever they built their sight with in silva's to these features regardless if they chose to build their platform and at erexit because nobody wants to rewrite this when i looked at rewriting my application into next turnout was going to be it was going to be a project resistant going to be a little thing so i acted imagine if you were on gatherings with what twenty total total exactly and that's a frustrating thing about the dead world is that people jump all over the place and the reality is companies and teams choose tack no years in advance and you can't you can't flip flop from that tackle i had so many people it was like it here i go in up getting my website to get by gets before from gazette and i had so many people there words remi and at that point had been out for like three days to lecorbeau of it's the new hotness you know like a pick at me to three years ago and i'm going to be on that for the foreseeable future i don't i would never even think to do that last no i got others i would ever think tourmente platanthera want to have to be set that's why i was all a press for otaheite a year i don't mind jumping in a fix in a few things or dealing with whatever but i don't want to have to baynell's talk about other features and as before parallel queries is the big one now so for an example i have bootstraps on my gastritis retraces of contact along with pages and i have to i queries i lie over them created page a gray all my blood post loover them create page cry all my to turtles laborer but now with parallelism because they have nothing to do with each other they're not waiting on each other for anything else so they can run a parallel now again that that will be things up significantly new data sanctissima big one for people who want to see the update right away there's entire businesses built on top of making gate update immediately so you can see what's going on right so there's a new data think that makes that a lot easier because people change something in them they want to see it on their website before they hit publish so the that makes it a lot easier to integrate with these different different cases get been ministered gesturing out a while ago called gatinais kind of like just a bunch of extortions going about that what ontogenesis aloof changes under the hood they did a really good job at not breaking too many things up dateless painless for me which i was really happy about and some pretty interesting stuff some curious to see what they will be rolling out in the future now that they've sort of set themselves up for this he meant the one thing of the gateways done in that you know been releasing consistently since like there's never been a point where you like a man the gametes really fallen behind here and other ways their hoary facing intonation i know that that really hard to do for this long so shotten toaster next move as we talked about this was next as as well i i'm betting they're gonna take some look at some of the future that remaining and saying the awed we put those in in our framework but beyond that for another show leave that for another show cool well this is seen hopening for me was quite sure we came and then the new update i'm not as upon this is you which is fun because i've been to open a gate had for a long time so i really need to see so and that's a fortissimo catch you on when day for a full untasted bessemer to santa ditmarshers and don't forget to

            "restoring to santa bianca with its easiest whippletree out their strap yourself in and a ready here is not to like and west boss book of to santa the pod cast with the most delicious tea treats about web development out there today we got a pollock for you this is where ubique tions we provide the answers we haven't done a plain i don't know maybe six weeks or so i've got all kinds of really really good questions about very les and astro and express in co and how do you handle retract but can keep the verb some pretty dirty ones what is the difference between graustark and web books oh my goodness i'm good ones to day we are sponsored by three assume companies and the structure content cascaron tracking and linda which does linschoten talk about all of them part way through the episode with me as though as mister scott to lensky honeycutt oh amory good got my work out in this morning i don't often like work out before work but on the day that like cornhouse works in the school when she has to go to work superannuated before we get going for the day and it's always nice something i just show up i pushed the button and it loses everything for me and then tell me what to do and i say yes yes to yeshibot really is for doesn't do the lift for you though bestemmiatore suing us experience beyond the complete page loads holinshead et homunculus now they linked to a agonise where is the the detail what it is what will this do to our cherish best practices of deferring scripts thou sheets images and found as it back to the drawing board or is it not a bit of a deal as i think it is so i chattanooga this ye have seen this giant one a super deep dive but i think my answer is not going to change regardless you know my opinion about any of these tools whether it is light room or light room light house or one of these performers trackers or trackers there there only has like useful as the person that's like reading it or consuming that data so far if you're kind of just running away house and blindly accepting the scores or saying that that is some sort of definite proof a i would say that it's not probably a great strategy and what you want to do is interpretress right it's running these these tests on your sight regardless of what they are and that to its back to you the data and i uptore whether or not that good or not like not all sides that have a hundred on light like compressing light whatever not every sight that has a hundred score on lighthouses in a good and there are plenty of sights that don't have that score that are also very good so again i'll go hontanon suppose and it gives you a road basha they're doing is there expanding the lighthouse score from just being like a very simple in the pages and then you get your score it to okaihau the accessibility or like one thing that one of our sponsors does century they provide you speed analytic based on just stuff that happens on the page like a click or very slow or arbitrary interested you gave the experience of somebody actually using your website and not just loading your website and i think this is great and it probably will make a few people upset especially these people that have one age one tag on their website and they say they get on gleichniss about tools over rolls and you should always think about the person using your website and not just oh i need to defer loading of a fondness and look at the result contemned one o you know make sure everything feels in looks nice while you're using it but again you know these things are good for missing tags as he otaheite as the word of truth so to say next question here is from mike quest greetings new book question alert arno barranca i am sure that i am executing in pommade safely i know that you shouldn't execute and pumas route i had miarenti have amorites question i think macalester used by devout i can see things so is that a yes okay so mike is basically having asking hey if you run an n scrape or note script on your computer how can you be sure that this thing isn't either you know maliciously adding or removing files from her computer in the answer that is global if you if you do want to install things globally which there are some things that are good to install globally outside of a package you want to make sure that you do not run sooner n whatever the command is because pseudo is going to give that admits and i could cause the malicious behaviour so if you ever see a peckover flop bob question where somebody says i ran and install hinges at the astor whatever and telling me i don't have permission do not just run pseudo whatever be not because you know in selling as that way is bad but it's open you up to running things on your computer that you don't know what it is and it is something that you want to be cognizant of and i think you can just change the permissions on and m itself and that will fix those errors but either way don't don't just arbitrarily run global skips on your machine if you're not exactly sure what they're doing if you want to be safe about it it's good to know what sudding on your computer because for a lot of people that's just what you have to say in front of the thing to make a work hankerton and you have to you should probably dig a little deeper into have i had of properly fix that i even i forget what package it was it was a couple of months ago a global installed something and i just popped a suitor of it and at that we don't support and stalling it eased and is like that angoutin me on that next question we have here from dover you guys have talks about prefixing bullyin with is or has in a really like this convention however if you have a function like is sick and you want to set a variable to the result of the function what you mean that variable you can't use is sick or you'll get a name collision in the function ality i usually end up renaming the function is sick but that is just said deleeberate i love the show i was going to say before you in finished reading this is that i usually just pop again in front of it i'm just looking at some coating right now and i have got dream get object list and get session so it this is a little easier with hedericus you can to hover over top of it and she type that it returns the reason why we have these is or has in front a sort of as a woodland notion and endicott you could call it get six status because that would that would be good as well but i don't see anything wrong with that i do something very similar but like like this person saying i don't ever name of i never name a function is something right i would name just the bully and that so that's kind of what i got out of this is if you have a function named is sei would never do that the function would be yet is sick or get said depending on how i'm feeling that day but just like you are usually prefect or a set or update or something and i little identifier there on the function intoleration the bellying nequen is from ben lammeters has got and less hooding well recently i had a few scenarios where i debated between using an enema verse a union type in typescript union and types seem similar but also seemed to be a matter of preference i was wondering if you guys prefer one in or maybe some of the benefits of them thinks okasaki of like in object where it has properties and values or just values that are arterards this is used if you want to say something is one of these potential values it is one of these values within this enobitti of this enos that way if the inside of the inmates as the stranger something then if you don't have even the capitalization correct on the states it's going to fail us it's not the same property and strings are very similar where you're saying he this type can be this strain or this string or the string or the string and nothing else so on the surface the seemed like they are very very similar and they are the very similar use cases the only reason i tend to use emails more than string unions is because with an enemy can actually use it in your jovian you can do comparisons so if you were using a string union and doing a comparison be hard coating a string in there like thing is equal to a string of active right however if you have an enemy could say if thing is equal equal equal to status not active which is reverencing one of the properties in the enumeration just arbitrary string this to me becomes easier to deputator updating things or need to change in the values and i had just kindlike the way it makes good things feel lescure it's not like a heresies to meet the requirements it's like it's using physically one of the actual trunk requirements i don't i don't know the matters too much i think it is more booreen thing but i do like that feature of enmities this reminds me of an retoucher you have your actions and people would take a string of the action like increment and then they would just like make a veritable called increment and then put a string in there an then they use that variable everywhere instead of an actual string and in almost every case i was just like well agencies the same thing with that potard it you have geheimrat ring a bit easier because it is an actual type and it's very bleacres things very easily versus doing like a fine place on a string but hastened forth with the using and in property to check something and choosing a plain string and i find that sometimes even with enamel okay what was the name tolbooth benefit of using em also is that everthing that are compiled into your job crept the end of the day the rest of typescript strike out but endear actual values there their objects and you can use those values even to do simple things like populate select drop down you have active in act of or cancelled in an anemometer that in an teutonically popular the drop down which is pretty cool so we don't answer for you sometimes insolent too much they really depends on the context for me and they are very similar in their usage next one we have here from raise assembly what problems will solve what are the benefits fertile is it coming or is it already here what my stolen what can i forget is that even learned yet all right sam web assembly illiterate a bit on this show i don't know if we've done a full show on it but with a wave just come of like heavily let's look it up on so many shows now now if we have done a full as no we bungled so weasel is the ability to run other languages in the browser and interface with them it was jovially good example is that pigmentation he called it the design program they used the callistonians crepitating most of the like heavy lifting of pigmies written in splashes and then they use javert they run it and weasel and the use jovissance with it and another example as we had the folks from stapleton and they are running no asinaean with weasely so like ikonin of think like okay because of whom or erable to run literally any language you want rest see puspang rustique a bit of stuff to a via via weasel assuming i don't not entirely positive but yet they have some really interesting blood tosabo their use of grass and why they chose to use the goliath on the show i think that we such an interesting show is asking them like hot and actually write surpluses and you know as i did do viderit of contact over there to the mister collins endosmose cast have the man but it is really interesting to i'm just i just searched pigmy rastrero our multi player sir or in rest in solemn service performance of permesso that is probably another not running in actual fight the server that run somewhere to talk to one to another but ferraiuola i'm i would like to do some was myself because i just keep hearing about really close of the problem as i don't know any other language i guess you could run no gain wastei have not done any warming but you know some people definitely get concerned about it taking over their jobs and things like that there's always a concern with stuff like this cleathes languages that are merely being used for was performance is like rest and in sea plushette people are using go laying a instant know too much about who was language is people are using weanies rest but you know they're not going to be things that you really need to worry about in oftentimes what we're seeing with many of these things is that the tolling of the people who write the stuff you know they write it and the new could take advantage of it and use these things there are some situations where would really come in handy i know that man godbehere compass which is very good they floater heavy processing of the data into was specifically there's a really good conduct but you know not everybody's doing that especially of your widener as a wiesener developer your building new eyes react or whatever ye you don't need to really know anything about weather than the fact that it is look what it is as well the simply in the prose dorante good example i just went to the awesome was i was like i bet there's an awesome wirebound there is there's a huge there's a huge reponne of the one of the wasps they have which is jason processing tool and it runs and weasel because i'm assuming a certain in some other language and if you have a amillion records that you have to jason carse doing that in the browse would probably crush the browse very very elidore and buffers and all that stuff and other languages are very good at doing data processing in doing a very quickly so often that's why people will reach for the languages to do that and the fact that you could run that in weasely is pretty nifty someone of the commons was the head adityans catering that back pretty nifty hat you know what else is it one of our spontaneity said is a unified content platform that powers better distemperance everybody that use sandys can olov it why because you the developer you get to write just plain old jobs pritty script to define your schemes for your data you can say all right i have i have a person that person has a name and a photo and then i have potatos and that is related to a person and then i can link all these things together and then the marketing people on the other side once you've built this thing and sanity the marketing polarising it because there's amazing you to edit your data and to relate it and to make custom work flows you got the marketing the u and compression images you name it and every misery body happy i think that they should put that on their website what is tendered happy and makes gondoforus syntax that's going to get you double the free usage ter thank you sanity for sponsoring thick supercargoes ion is from will adams he says you recently didn't episode on the macaronis as what happened to scott using line i i what is i asafiel i recall that an otterton if i recall it eremitical correctly of my recall as agreed call two words weisheit hed to papalagi so here's a service my limits latinic is fine in it is not macaskill tell you that it's it's not you know there's a lot of upside toinette has been a lot of trouble and if i wasn't blue with the command line or used to using the commanding to do anything honestly that computers almost dead in the water just because papa was limits and general it's it's not the same experience as you get working on a ambition by it as a production machine and what i did is the reason why i bought that machine is because at that time i had one laptop in the house in one laptop only my wife did not have a computer she didn't have a laptop i had one laptop and if that thing went down or went away i would have nothing to give dispatcher papaws lineatus the back up instead of going with like a man but to be honest i should have got my gamecock are cheapest mac look error something like that because honestly i just don't think the experience is very bad in popolare machine fine but you know there are divers sues occasionally if to go the command line to do a whole bunch of stuff a lot of the applications are half asked so ye it's okay honestly now that i've gotten this new computer and my wife has been now got my six mither maupin i would like to sell this limits i'm just not going to use it talons if if any one likes it may be i'll put it up for sale we can talk about this right now if you are interested in a sedate seventy six laptop just happen upon twitter we can work out a price or something for it is in perfect condition i just hardly ever use it so that's where it's at back up machine got up to be a back of machine and its fine but it's by no means competing with this machine once however i'm very curious if you could hack and to it because it's like a like a juicy beef computer right now really i got i got like wooable with it and independently on the market place to day so noiseless host and you can deliver you want on these servers but they have the thing called the market place which allows you to install a whole bunch of stuff to run your server so they have all of the popular control panels out there so you will see panel or flask webbed men who boisrene you name it you can stall that and get the control panels for managing it but they also have stacks so if you want to get a merry have a mango de b express react and the end in what the end in the end men for no jail click it and you will automatically have monte expressed react and no jest and their far wall and stalled for you and you can get up in running hosting your react and express application super quickly so chuck it out they're goin to give you a hundred bucks in free credit when you go to indoctrinating you not for sponsoring next weave here's from sadako you bade requests in no gas to napkin of interesting question so you have to send off a six or seven or quest to a piora whole bunch of stuff how do you watch those together so there's a couple like different ways you can sort of look at this is i've got to make seven request right now how do i do that while if the apiest batching you are kind at a lock that kind of what graywell is is that you could send in gradual you can send as many requests as you want in a single grashus and then the server that is running the a p will be able to run all the data base requests and fulfill all of that that data then send it back in a single request of that huge benefits and grafton do is you can make a throttle or de ounce or requests so that's not necessarily patching them but that will you to do if you're worried about sending a request too often to an apotheola denounce them live on over the difference amenities in this broadcast with the differences between the two but essentially that will only allow you to run them once every hour or for many seconds and that will stop you from totally a slam in the apswith euthemio i used to build when every single request that you said them they send you back a head or that tells you how many requests you have flapdoodle some some parsing of that hated just to make sure that i'm not going over my limit and then being returned no data when i really need it you like i think you covered all your basis here and there is even was in graywell besides just writing all of your your values inside of the query there you can even do batching in a lot of the graperies outside of the graphic where you're saying he just performed these multiple queries in old coffined the as in array rather than a just a single string of one so that tetotally doable depending on how you serve her handles the swell yankee it next question here is from rail rail says lately i keep hearing about my rorie's what is it was the benefit what are the kinds okay mironda the idea that you can use multiple front and framework or multiple versions of a front and framework in one code base and have them all placed some one nice together is this something that the majority of developers will ever need to worry about my opinion now this is like this is a situation where you have a team and the team is large there's there's people in different sections working on different parts of the sight and they have different ecrivent or different that maybe somebody built something in felt somebody else built something in angular you want them to play nice together right so that's why you would use a micro front and system right a system to control and wrangled multiple front and frameworks and or versions within one project but would that means is really that's not something that the majority of developers are going to hit like evolve up to trials to come started using multiple front and frameworks please i take it out back take it out battle on the side of or whatever give rid of it it is that that side of webster project is not need of microphones going to make things terrible soiling small isolated versions of an apparebit has bobbed up i think three times now in my career was called many sites initially and then it was god the micro sites and now it is called micro front hands and usually all of these are the answers to bureaucracy mannacan move fast enough or we can't build what we want to build inside the existing realm of what our company as we are goettengen website that are need maintaining and on all these silly frameworks i thought were pretty popular at the time and didn't work out and some of them are still running on guanas me how i know so i don't know like the talk to a lot of people who are in big companies and this is just how they do it you have a team that works on react and of another team that works and spelt and they are they both used the same apis there's another team that builds the apis and then they just dash out the data and then each team is allowed to sort of pick their own tack in an honestly at the end of the day there much more efficient because that team is as able to do it so that's a kind of a fancy word for just saying let people work out by themselves because there's too many meetings and i can't get done when i want to do italian did run into his situation where this would have been handy when i worked at fort because there were multiple teams in fact since when i were a four day the agency out a whole bunch of stuff to many different agencies there and oftentimes those agencies would come with their own their own system right in fact i always laugh like one of them one of the guys what are the guys on one of the teams that they like contracted out you some of that that precious like big big three money to write tests for the fessor a prototype that was only going to be shown in one meeting everything up central at their performance metrics because that's a feature of century that i use all the time the episode is also sponsored by century a century daimler single time i go on a century i feel like there's some something newer or great restore to check out because there's some great features in the thing but again the performance meant attracting metric is really one of the coolest things on this and it's one of the newer features a century to century is an iron exception healing too that alice how europian is functioning whether or not there's lots o bugs are no bugs or whatever is set but you also see performance tracking metrics with a user misery score things that are telling you just how fast any individual route on your sight is and i just if there are any thing were users are hitting a snag or it's taking too long or there's one particular section of your simancas loading or causing some sort of errors or something but you can see all of that heavily and more you can see all of that right next to your issue tab you releases us your feedback ladoga dashboard stuff that you can get if you have one of the business accounts but just endless amount of cool tools of you want to check all this out and have some assomption in erinnerung tools honourer down i used to counthree that is it a street all or case all one word you'll get two months for free well well well worth your time next question only have from deston's forgot i'll readily answer since as roses amazing aren't you tempted to rebuild your sight now an astronomer as well yet i am and i think this is half joking because scott is a golden retriever of jobs remarks but also half serious coronado entire business and livelihood in astrolabes assailed it here's the deal it's not the same thing said to us in like an application and a web building a framework where you can build a ton of different types of sights in my sight is primarily a dynamic site right there's a lot of user base things where that just does not make sense to be a static set astro is a static sight generator in if it may be if my sight was rottiniga i might think who would be kind of cool to rebuild this an astrogator fun but i would only be a just for fun thing it wouldn't be anything serious but either way you're comparing solitary is not a super good idea because they have very different use cases on stromenti if you're thinking static and they serve first and static primarily not only go after but if you need you know that that serves in the dynamic server date to come back and your aeternitate no not as well as or seriemas well next question we have here from andrew thanks for all your doing you are both legends and what was that what was the movie or people were saying everything is legendary for a while i don't know but there's a outjutting watched the dislike speed running for video games to day always go you absolute ledesma's that is that how it minoote initiative seen this show before is one of those things i had escaped its original use and is just made its way in a meaner anyway thank you for calling his letter odious shed some light on readiness she contend this in saying retires in literally every server framework ever because this is not a specific question to express my understanding is that redcar the same method across from the original and point what if i like to redirect from post to get for example is that when these three one through to three seven three come in handy i can't find any good reason or is this to understand the things again so this is a good question when you are redirecting somebody i guess i kind o is express question because when you read erect someone in express you essay like response to redirect for its lash the new page i've lots of these my application because i've changed around the orator over time and it's really funny how often i get emails from somebody who's like six years old or seven seven year old mail there applying to like alligator enormous support the link i sent to sevenpiper direct in there anyway express handles redirect as a three two which means that if you post something to arica to a yet so if you are trying to save some into a database and change that you and point than you need to use a different retreatants or three or three or three or seven come in you can also do a thrill one reader act which is permanent three or two will change post to get our able i change every whatever were sent to it post but get deltas make into a get through three or three o seven will maintain the firm at three one will not maintain it so again back to the original one but that is permanent so if you accidentally sat permanent redirect you are kind of pushed until the brow the user gets a new computer rand then so just be very very very careful with ordains me how i know and then a threat of maintaining the verb but it is permanent again so always kind of side on a temporary redirect until you absolutely know and it's usually only use permanent redirect for like so reasons as you you want to tell google though this is this article is mood for ever to this new era so that's that don't don't take what i'm saying for it look it up but yes that you can specify the number these aspects when you erect in your frameworks including expressing cower i am returning any status code i feel like i have to have the table in front of me just so i can make sure that i'm utilizing the right one because you do you want to use the right one okay dick when here is amatolas he only recently started listened to the potatory night shift found yours soon after a newsboy go to an okement retained in has got me through some tough times so i wanted to massive say a massive thank you will thank you thomas so far within two weeks i have gone through a masterman of episodes i can't remember what episode it was but it got me thinking if you could make an episode on being a developer with aid and then to night i heard an episode about a t shirt shipping on the twenty first of april and one of you said that you have aided and i wanted to ask you how you deal with it and the combination of being a developer how does this impact your billy to stay concentrated on a single project in a general starting and finishing projects hoping makes sense thank you again for being here during my night shifts and gave me through some tough times i thank you tomasso i do have a deed and it was something that i didn't know for two long and my life i just felt like a was in great concentrating or any of that stuff i eastenders tests despite being like a forenoon tebaldo and you know i had good grades in corisco and in most part for college but like the classic things that you would say like hathis person has a learning disability i would pretty much fail on so definitely have either fidgety i'm always looking around i'm always doing something i've always consuming like eight different streams of information as a lot of things there for me i personally think that we should get portions my wife she's the doctor psychology to talk about it and some strategies for dealing with it because i know a lot of people have similar issues and for me the things that keep me focused her like ospitale about using a focus out for my mark i have you know focussing some my phone set up so that i can open certain absence in times kind of like building in these tools to help me along and concentrate and not get too distracted and i think a corny would be really great to have unanswerable attending the doctor of psychology so i don't want to onotowatishika attention to what systems are working for you in terms of like what's being able to keep you focused in the end keep track of that you know some some simple things for me if this simple is like going to a coffee shop and putting on headphones and give me into a place of mind where i'm not consuming a different things because i entreated out the other day that like having multiple monitors is sometimes like a net negative for me concentration is because i'm looking around all the time i got too many windows open it it's not like focused mode so there's a there's to stuff there around focus and i'm sure i'm sure just in general there would be a lot of technique howdacious how tydeus i'm i'm all over the place and have a hard time focusing sometimes and what not so so courtney can diagnose you with him that's like what she does or her job not specifically eh but she's testing children or learning disabilities or attis or whatever and she has done an a massena tests and essentially light now like a couple of like a two day long test that like one of the things she does to understand to learn these things but for me she was just like a i don't know why i didn't see it for so long you definitely have abdicated tain't really do anything for me i'm not going to get out medication for it it just helps me understand and be able to research a little bit better was an hundred deal with it so the same it would another however come up but like ye had a hard time concentrating on undoing my test but i also like my like god retriever added to a sack about the again is he has gotten me into some good good spot and life as well so i parted me just like a economise that alone it would be really nice to have a scholastic up with an absurd amount of ideas but it's always when i'm trying to think about something else or to lie terence in the side that's like not necessary to be worked on but there are necessary sections that i i should be spending my time on is just like things like that where it's like a i really wish i could have a little bit of focus sometimes in teriolis personal responsibility there you know i have the ability to control myself it's just it's just not easy right of entree lot of people feel that way as well next question we have here is from elegies i heard wasting that he uses gittites for managing features of his projects and i started doing so but i have a small project which is linking commit messages with issues stood a good good idea i mean should i repeat the name of the issue on the commonest resolves issue number issue number and because agathe you have a commit you can put in issue number in the command and get her boy automatically link it up and mention it in the issue so you can see that there was a communicant that specific issue i know it's a question but i am very confused as what to do so he say what i'll do is i won't just say resolves issue number will usually say add feature picture and picture for a video player resolves issue number whatever so i'll do a quick explanation of what it is because that helps me what i'm doing get log in the terminal as well as lingual issue scottpore conventional commence here we do show on it like a year ago and we both said that we are going to take this conventional commit seriously and i have not so using it have you a year we did for a whole year her since malakand i have i both have been looking alias in my main line but i also have an extension for it within this code that allows me to easily do conventional commit because let's face it as we just talked about my memory things like that aren't good i never remember what the pattern is for conventional commit and in that it could be seen as a barrier to enter but if you have an extension that specifically for conventional convinced forces you into that structure now i don't know honestly if there is things in here for monrepos but i figure it's a good way to at least even in what your committees could be like i would imagine there's something with monopolistic and how you do it but this is a good a good way to be very regimented about your comtesse away that keeps everything organization this person with this person wasn't talbot monono but you you use some unrepaid but the reason why i went about a repose we had another question about commencement in the in the politest to the one just assumed it was the same question either way conventional commence be a good solution for it that all right next question is from it sifting hastiness i really enjoy listening to your pocasset exercise i have two questions do browsers ought to matriculate automatically for example when i see a feature that supported by crothers is that mean that all from users have the speakers want to say yes household never close it but when you do close it crumbs going to be like i will love deynoot of browsers crom edge fire fox they all up at themselves and they've gone into a way words just kind of being done behind the scenes almost like edge as they get out of date there's just like a little green arrow in the top right corner and a few chickadee refreshes it with the diversion so a lot of modern browsers do unfortunately staring far an apple being hampton updates so far with a subtile come on and twenty twenty one erupting spiritual so does it mean that all people no not all people but it means that most people will because the act is kind of hard to run a really old person of chrome or edge or whatever unless you're almost intentionally running a very old version of itself for the most part it means that most people get those features yeild even know how to stop from from maroudi i did i did hit it once where i had people somebody that worked for a canadian government contact me and something was working on my website i was like what the act and the he gave me the he gave me that filaree this is before we had sponsor century and sallowest allfired that the canon government just pegs come out a certain version and then like runs it for however long which is security issue and itself i guess but they were on the twenty versions behind which is like three years old version of crome were running so they had a contract it in whatever and get it up deed but yet most people get the the updates even with even with peoples i phones and so far they will eventually the problem a little slower of date but this is not like ten years ago this was awful with ye were like you would you howter people to buy a new computer before they would update their presence you could update it but there was no autorite was no software update built into windows that would do it you pretty much just had to wait for people to buy a new computer for they would update it but there was the murderer's this huge huge push of people and stillingfleet members computers he headed that is good now i had a when i was in college i did computations for like older folks and one of the guys i did was like this like famous university of michigan domestics coach whose super famous and i used to go to a house one a week and help him with his computer and he was so funny because we got him up on fireboxes he was using some old version of the e of course and he felt he only called it foxfire and i was the cutting in the entire world i love it hekataeus the second part of this question is i haven't worked on a real project before and i wonder when you work on maintaining a big project what do you do in eight daylight hours i mean is there always bugs and has i also wonder do you always work on having new features or just being tainting okay so this a good question for me i'm working on a project of largely coating all day on it i'm not recording or doing the pacas and the things that i typically work on since its custom platform was it just yesterday i added a ditto any page of a content altama to the form so hey here's editorial page i want to edit this specific one an now there's a little edition that tutorage i just like the button in automatically sums me to the adonais like that right these are little features people are going to be working on the site where going to be editing content authors creators whatever the unmature that's easy for them buildeth by this we were looking in our black fardels and wondering like how does this compare to previous black fridays i don't know we don't normally take metrics like that oh let's build an charibert love pilchards weatherproof it if i am fixing a couple bugs for week and sometimes egbert and you investigate them for twenty twenty minutes or thirty minutes and find out that it's actually something with the users on browser maybe they have a vestigator sonata somebody the other day were trinobantes no sound and turns out his head on were broken so that kind of unhappiness funny because you do occasionally get a common thing like i cannot play in the of your video on my my browser my god lets restart the browser let's update it and close it oh that is it okay yet next question we have four from delineate one can you help break down and explain the jargons between our braster and grafton that as well and separate question is on the standard formats for data as content transfer at dispeople one out there in the world and what that is i and i on your severities outspent web development world quite know if i've ever i've ever interface with weber sorcerers the best i can sort of understand from it is that you describe the task at hand and you send the entire tasso the what i understand is that our band griffith you do all of the work in building the instruction on the client and then you send that over to the server or to the actual device and piles very popular in low power such situations its a big user there that black kind amind me of grace that's the next one is graffiti more what you are doing and what data you would like back from it and then you send over that entire he said over that entire request and it brings it brings it on back to you old forgot to say abysses deer press the framework built around a besso of a set of framework standards and then finally web hooks is kind of like opposite of rarest request because your web hokeis when something happens blockbuster somebody by something on your website then the server will pain you i will paint most likely opinion other server with the youantee you can do what you want with it mardonius's for me it's like i feel like i i got to heavy know i won from rest to gratulation i don't know i need to another day otranto in my life i think that i don't think that it's like a thing for a web i think it like if you were like interfacing with a raspberry pie or howsome sort of controller and they the other part of the question is jontarou yes but not always when i worked with when i work with the drone like these like low power things don't necessarily have the power to jason string o ye something before they send it so they just they send it as like a new line or a cab delimited or comes in between every piece of data and then you have to just persevere often they will be standards like our present there will be some sort of package of bible that will light you to passion whatever language is equivalent of an object as it's all interesting and is very interesting all right i think that is it for the questions thank you for submitting i'm please keep them coming because we love doing it got to santa and the top rancor i says as apologues ion but type into the box at the smith button and we will answer it on the coon the episode i let's rotisserie pigmies i do have a sick aerating there's been so many cool things in my life lately i recently got a robot back in although i'm not going to stick that just yet some well mantalini it actually has been very nice to run the thing although he ran it in the middle of the night that woke both of us up it was just bumping doorkeepers initially reincarnated the nightingales tinsmiths or stay i don't i don't know how they pronounce aetatis is a tachytes for wireless charging it rules its pretty awesome if you have an phone with the bank noon the back or even just any one with less magnet thing that he talked about or a piece of metal that you can use to worry us charge this is great stand at a three and one stand so it can charge your your watch your air pods and your phone all in one stand off of one cable and it's pretty minimal it doesn't have a lot of knowing leadership ones but not really so if you're worried about it taking up some light space this is nice little stand and it's a little expensive but it does all three things and it does them very well and i've been really liking having one thing on my dresser but i can just put all my stuff on rather than having like four cables that antonina you know take a whole much allifae i'm going to sick pick the always sunny boaster are a bunch of its always sending in philadelphia post out there but this is one that the actual actors of its sanpriel phia go on and what they do is they just take a apathetic a show and then they just sort of talk through it and then they just go on these warious rats and the way that they act in the show is very much holyhead for life and i was just been howling listen to it so is super super funny the always sunny boast of the truest the trending hatasoo one shameless plugs was boss doomford as courses concealest evolve my courses master gets be began a jovita and maceration gratulant a whole bunch more check it on out is a capacitor ten bucks off sick i'm going to shamelessly plug the latest course on level of the trials the doom which its accessibility for

because i've been dipping my cosimo fell here and there and then i have also been going back into my react projects and this is not going to be a beat up on react episode we've done that already but we do want to do an episode of leomont ings you want to do it in an application in hers how you do those in poltandie let is very simple a yeah i though you were going to say i'm feeling variously because we are both oh billina parent life this this parsimonia dog dog dad so my images were up by three times last night and then our dog to start barking in the middle of the night and as i like whenever that happens i slip on her i opened the amonoosuck the cameras make sure there's no drug enthusiasts sir something like that if you nourishing for some odd reason and annoying they would play down miall of the city pipes on our honour block in our neighborhood and it's been taken like a wet i mean taking long time because you know the lot of pipe they got to dig up but he would just grease no longer going to be lead pipes thank you oh that's going to be fantastic but we've been sleeping with the windows open because it's like perfect weather for that and it just so happens and yancy a little guard dog she goes not said the morning allegation the morning when they they started the construction stutsman i belathered get the line those placed as well as a hoadley thing which is going to be fantastic for us as we were not like about the pipes i have a funny story about above those led water pipes so we when we moved into our house or housepainters off and i was like the water really ever need that see it just a meditative and we just covered it over which is on a high awful and then like like eight months later we go to get our lead pipes or place it's a coming every house in our city needs to have the line from the street lacedaemonian when dolinski it was not big deal they just put another one somewhere else and in our front lawn but i always was freaking out there for a second on don't cover those things administration talking about led by talk and let's get into some sponsors we've got two to day fresh books and log rocket he talk to you about fresh books its

exceptions happen in a scruple replying you know less actually had to use lowered this week end because the time were recording this is like the black friday sailed canonisation to the cyber monday that were recording a so i i had a little issue and it was so bizarre it was a weird little bug where one user in particular was not able to get their caricatura tion to go through it it wasn't a decline it was not even reaching my payment processor as i said kathie perfect opportunity for me that outlook i fired up logotheti could see what the air was that they are saying i was able to look into their user account and i was able to actually see the council armitage that was coming back from the new work were quest as it happened in a let me to realize that this particular use aflower account from his older count which had some interesting old data and at which as something can happen with langonnet in his object in the everything just worked totally fine but totally o bug and not one that i have ever had before and willowdale jobs of autocratic give it a check videretur in exceptions lonaconing less talkative haviland of the past episodes about felt faultiest kit sosone but felt kid is pretty new and you can kind o think of spells react and spell it as next day and it's a new job framework library whatever you call it for building weapons and scott got specifically has turned me on to his cotherstone's for it and rewrote platform in it right you bet eatened a comfort to one that a saltimbanco that oranmore about that that is amazing and scott was so enthusiastic about it i decided to try to build a couple of things in it and by a boy is an awesome so i thought we'd do episode that just kind o goes into the major pieces of building application local state updating reactive conditional rendering imputing and child's elements there certainly a lot more to either ear sardinians and injust go into how they work in and what not yet definitely the stuff that you need to do in just about every original stuff so that the barrier first thing you ever do in an apis get local state up and running right if you're learning a friend and framework i remember the angular one example would have been like the first little blurting it was like a local state and example so local state in pellissiers setting a variable and then updating that variable so instead of having to use like a function like in reached us a state hook that then creates the state variable and the state of daturon and then to access the current state in the updated a call back to access that current that you have to do any of that you just have a variable let's say the variable name is who is the coopers ever and it said discontent that to say no actual the coopers noiseless is now equal to west and that i actually automatically a bit the for you with that you having to worry about renders the current value of anything because when you are accentuation that's one weariness the other day where i was i radiolaria and i'm going like between white screen and not wide screen so to have a very wide screen true so i state and then a great an updated that takes the current variable of wide screen and just lipsittsville falls ressemble toggle function to turn the very bloodiest angegeben like you should actually use the call back like i know the updraft common and also has a like one thing that i've talked about it my courses is that like yes they tell you this is the best practice but has there ever been a situation where you end up getting the wrong version of the variable and it gets confused is specially for a simple tale that head i've i've certainly run into it but her but with my roof somebody were to hit the button so fast that they were out clicking the event loop it like the than the menteith's not going to actually happen like and that's not all all races like i know i know why people need to call back an i know when to use it and i decided not to use it there because literally never going to happen but it people that have like sort of rules about specific things as this either with so many this like react best practices articles is that like the shaded of context sometimes in it like just do this do this do this do this whether is the ears the actual concern there are the level of it issue same thing with did the arount ions i showed like a component being exported function search component and then some one like wire uniting an arrow function i comicality would i liquidate it of using her function there they had no some one chimed in with the the i don't castissima potato use this then he after noting as then it doesn't matter there's no benefit of that i think like we talk about this a few times were when we got arruntius people sort of swung over to them as like these are the new functions in regular functions are deprecated but certainly not the case in it's a funny because i wish i think the biggest thing about moving to sell as you no longer worrying about what react is thinking about like some erika's react what is react thinking right now i don't have to like tree read rearin because of just looking at the variable it's not like what is all wanted i don't know it is just jamesville changed a variable you've updated all right next one a function that update state so imminent one so say you have a very able called score which is talbot how making it but you want to have an updated or function because that function has some sort of logic inside of it a very simple existence you could just pittoresco i'm curious alike what would your approach both if he osinins of that cross your entire application or you want to have multiple instances of that score variable and have update from tonsor each of them similar to howard work and react so basically okay so theaetetus single state variable in a function you want to up at that function you could just have it be a straight up variable and they straight up function if it's in that duntroon as props if you want and then bind if you want to change it later further down in the tree if you want or you could pass the function down just like rat nominalism is that many of the react patterns if you want to use them through there for you you can pass and up betterton down if you want to do that or you can have the child a bit it with a fine function if you want to have these things available just sort of outside of a solomon for importing you something that you could take a a right able store which is basically a subscription were used subscribed to a variable and then you can update it you can create custom one where you have your own functions in advance reducing like that so you can certainly stored in a spell rideable or you can have as a normal variable and function and pass it down as for the the hook approach there is a sort of use state of pattern that end up being basically the exact same type of deal in fact some even made a reaction spelt reoch remplies any of the reactors if you really like working in the reaction you can see what all of those actually end up being like but the end result is really that you were just creating a state variable in hooks and you can compose the state that way me it so hard to explain these things in a podesta a independently you good examples that a good likeness live and react of variable so by default variables insult are just live meaning that if you put a variable into a string or into some homelier anything when that variable updates then spelled with that new value in the thessaly really nice and i really wish that villacorta and that's kind of nice to be able to just use that specific value if you want to go a little bit further and maybe use that valuation by seven because you want to cacadores or some somewhat you just put a dollar sign in front of it and that shows felt to watch for those bodies to change and it will update the value for you that's right go right as correct and there's other ways you can do that if you have a subscription to let you had a stock right above store or a readable story and you wanted to have that a drive store available from that there's like a derived luminance derive stories well which is also a very similar technique because your basically saying hey any time any of the information in the store changes of battisterio stories well but so i end up if i'm getting like reactive stuff based on something else i'll use the reactive statement or i'll use a drive storekeeping on what that incoming data is but what was really nice is that you can use those in any sort of block capacity too so if i were to say dollaires and just created block essentially anything in there an then become reactive so you can do a whole bunch of stuff went in woods essentially a use effect without having to worry about what the dependencies are or worrying about the renderer any of that so that really great one thing i think the activity and spell relieving it of the things that you have to like worry about like counsel counting rendering cycles wearing about infinite loops those types of deals are away harder to do it well with recoverable just because there's just a way to do it you don't have to program the dependencies or anything like that yourself it's just baked in for extrication allows you to pass data between components without having to manually pass them down and that's that's very hopeful and lots of applications because you can write a component anything that you pass in the following data but sometimes if you have it every nest a deeply application is hard to pass that stuff down all the way down so will you do as you stick that in contact high up in your application in your sort of able to just grab it out of the air so to speak with with raconte so small racked oily has conduct appell has conduct apis well i'm curious like you use that or do you just import and export stores in most cases i know i have never used the context meprendre much only use stores in that regard he insures a release i have basically a illegal state folder that has an alias path to it that just state so i want to but say if i want to and i say tugalo in state for the entire application all i do i say dollar sign loading equal true after importing that and because what that does is that basically gives you a rectifiable three out your entire application so instead he having to worry about where is the parent where is the child would what kind of context exists in this thing you end up being able to say oh i just have this tractable and anywhere i use the thing in the entire application just have to be reactive and when i change it just have it update and when i set it up dative and and some people get a little bit scared about that because they feel like it could be too willynilly but you can if you want to lock it down more you can create your own custom stores with your own update or functions so you don't like changing a variable you can have no better function that changes the parable you can have a reduction do any of the same stuff you would with contact if you really want or you can justification the dear and you can change the state of your application at any given point just from the side bar without indoor about parent child and the stuff so a man to him and just reading these dogs here asses context versus stores what's the difference is said they differ in that stores are available to any part of an april context is only available to component and its descendants this can be helpful if you want to use several instances of component without the state of one interfering with the state of others in fact you might want to use the two together since context is not reactive values that change overtime should be represented as historians something that is not reaction use context as well yes a context explicitly is in reactive but staring at a store in context would be reactive interesting yeasting of minor difference i could see how he could probably get away with it looks like the flexors grid kind o thing where they have lots of overlap and some differences here and there yeaston rendering and conditional rendering is actually really pretty neat were talking about it like the temple let's say you have like commination that the most common was that you see this is like if something is loading show along screeners shows something else or maybe you have like a a modulates variable is such a truth and show model otherwise don't so the very most basic you have a pound if and then the variable and then anything inside of that bracket is going to be showed now you can also do a coin else air your just a cornland then you wrap it all off with a forward lessening the temple so tis very most basic it's just a condition hotherwise other condition whatever showing now there's also some really interesting promise based tax and even like a another one that only gave people really think about so if you do pound away and then a promise solicit you have some dated that coming back from a nap that's a promise you could say pound away data and when that data is unresolved you can show a loading screen in the new and say calanthe what is whatever the variable name of the results will be and then you can have your results in there so you can await a promise inside the template itself which is really super handy is something that we've used quite a bit now another cool thing about the pound away as that you can use it with felt stores as well so when there's the store data resolves you can use it as well and you cannot really call if you don't want to show a loading screen at all like for instance his brassie situation or something you could do pound await the promise and then then all in line so you don't have to have a loading state of otowaya can just do await the thing then whatever the result is all in one tempted and you can even restructure in that so we for instance would have legs await our gratuity then brackets latest series or something the data whatever the variable name is that coming back from the gratulations basically a one line to await a promise and then structure the variable that i want in the ethandune interesting tattooed in her ways for that block rightly you have if you've got counteth it that will still render out or does that stop everything beneath it oh it's a great question i want to southlook because it's the similar to like reasons where you have a suspended component that's waiting the rest of the component still render like it it would i don't think it would render like the heather and then you wait for the user component and then when that's done then then then the footer renders a highly doubt that an i don't know to be honest we don't use it and in these sororities infrastructure it's like always something that's like a clincher dere only thing that wore were using it on so i've never been in the situation where this is like the thing i'm mating on but i'd be interested to figure that out as well eatinest on mettrie after this poast near the old teetotaler on his airs now another other interesting thing that you could describe as conditional rendering is a key block in spelt where a pound he value is something that you can use to swap out data and fate uses on the editorial page whenever a change it tutorial or changing the value of the key which is the idea of the tutorial and that abides the content inside of it so he block destroys and recreate their contents when the value of the key changes when the key expression changes so if the key is changing there and you have some things and you want to they even do it a transition between them you can grow up a transition culminate on the thing or anything and it will conditionally change that block out of that key chansonnettes imputing this is one huge huge thing that i like about literally every other antislavery have verberation input in most framework is simply just have some sort of bindasov's bind convolute on an input as an attribute of your gemonian it will immediately bind that to it and as you type into the improbability do that an i don't want to keep aginanwater love react in saturating that i do but this is a nicer than the real world where you have to create states create an update or function handle the key up value intercept it heave get the value of what that event would have been said that to stay and then it would put in inheritance even has a reality for making this easier but like this is like this is what we do as developers make boxes with text in it and we patates and that is such a core thing of applications that it being so sillily hard in an recordite it's so silly in you one of the reasons why i silly to me as i remember going to a job interview for a back bone sight and this was in bed went back bone and you know macular one old before reactive existed really and they would say that they were they had a innervation for me no like right can you do some wiborad cutting here and show how you would update doome two way dat abounding in and they knew i didn't use backbone so they were asked me all the questions and angular just to get my general proficiency throwing can you show us how you would do to a date upon in and as i really can't because it does does it for you and they are juliette though i yet does it for you you don't have to worry about telling yanson because that was a very long time ago and then the amount of work that you have to do to get data by ningrat brings me back to the backbone days of things we had to mount of stuff at the duty to yourself solacement ways especially would working with forms but it is really nice to be able to cravenette and past into the form nineteen object to the entire form and not have to worry about it you just have access to it like the metal day it does it a really good job doing common things like number imputations for numbers and belianis of newhaven a parson and coherent the actual value and it also you can use the same indentations on mentative all that kind of stuff ensuring my entire video player right now for my course aditional worther westover was like already have eighty per cent of the contraction thereover and also the heart part of like making video players the fricken aspect ratio the key never know how people are going to be watching it so you have to like skinny and tall screens wide and short screens and people who want wide screen but people who want a smaller wide screen but the list of videos beside it think of every single possible lay off that of thinly that but i like to play did the browsers all implemented these crazy auto play rules behind the scenes now so if you ever have any issues with a opland it be be it because each website has like an reach browser has like tannhaueser for the user that's like bees that determines whether or not the content is safe to auto play for you it's so weird and impossible to deputies some people would do say he annalise with auto play and at such that you can't be like a man it's all good and is just the browsers behind the scenes score by your tobacco of the air yonder good example of like market burrowing for the rest of us here because like i have to do that as well and i like throws an error when he tried to play a video when you're not allowed to so like i just like at the error wheathampstead to wait for the user actually click click the air and i have like just a catch that i just catch a throwin the abyss because i know has exactly all beheaded elements so has this concept called lowell really like so when you have a continent and then when you use that component you can just by default whatever's inside of the component open and close tag will be in the default lot and then you can also name the slots themselves so you can say right this is going to be decided by law this is going to be the main contents slogwell be the footlights go where you want them to go and really nice apiece and you can also use the spell considerate recurs lots which is cool and need feature you have detesters that are they make sense to be recourse output like a folder structures in the need onoway folders are going to be inside of a folder structure we use it are imputations as funny because some people just folitton thing was that may be a better amiabilities like it's a thing you're saying here is the slot it's not just so indeterminate children it's like this is a component and this the component that will you place in here to me it feels explicit but i can understand that like yes well you can still pass down a component of the props if you want to right oh italy i have no idea because i've never done that i don't others many like advanced patterns and react that i just have not needed in pelleterie how to do things in spotlight that would be a good one just because i've been playing with it here and there and i had questions for scott on catalonian what you're thinking of all lathered rich harris to work on shellfull time which was amazing forsooth folks behind next day and i think that makes a lot of sense is they don't care what you're using the otaheitan money to buy two of the biggest atabapo cation framework out there which is so cool to see soldanieri excited i absolutely very excited to see what the future holds there for us so cool well i think that said on wednesday we're going to be hit me with a really cool guest on a well just a little bit a little bit more protecting stuff so we will catch you then on wensday base beast and over to senatorial our selves and don't forget to subscribe in your bobcat player or drop a rebel if you like this show\n",

today we have a very interesting show for you talking about jobation even know how you describe is but like using jongran and maybe will educate languages as well in a situation that is not your tip of a wearing in a desk top browse so obscure in other places and salabaetto in just a second of my first we are sponsored by three awesome companies lined cloud hosting log rocket abscission reply and printouts are new sponsor of ours they make some really cool wet components he can drop into her web at for doing a chart and scheduling the really cool talk about party of them part with through the episode with me as always is mister scott polensky how you into the contingent and the normal marketable friday that hated so eating and we also have our guests on today is aunt regained a mahabaleshwar do well or cited have you on so a little bit of back story here am i don't know like maybe a month or two ago i tweeted out like where else is jobs of being used on because i know like i use these as on my phone or on my tante tapps are built in like a specifically i use one that's called by and they have the actual apt is the same exact same ap on your desk top as it is on your phone as it is on my t v as it is on the pad and i've always marvelling at like well the thing is like sings rocks all is a really nice ap and it works just so well across all of the different ones that we have and as like like where else is it you and then moustai totally unrelated and set me a message on isegrim's like an working on some like it suffering now it's pretty interesting and then i also work that meinander i didn't ask him any questions as i want to leave it for that for the actions with the head unit in josaphat that i just want it which but a car just put a new stereo in it and i was like man of merely cool like i wonder what these things are are made in or even even talking to them so we give us a little introduction of her what you do things like that to sobrante tecolote years always been a developer i was developed by a mustache when buster and northeastern certainly wasn't dewelopment tenants factories and doing suffering your the longest time i elaboration sisters part opinionation things like i am but in all the years the more experience again the more things are worked on it to belief we can we can interfere with anything on we can build anything you want us in modeling is like lord or some of the more to work with all languages are initiated some people cannot like shaitans time the only way you could do it and but then observe in lord and insteader me everything easier for every one and a fellow a whole night that one dear you are having a house all of these and gesticulate licensed heavily hersell hardly integrated kitasato to almaden weaken we can just make an express or than a wall of this information arising that that's really cool to me because i've dipped into that world a couple times i'm not by far and good at any of it but in the past i have used not to talk to a drone and that is like i don't even know what language is running on the drone but it just communicated a outpointed text commands to it and i've manicate with learmouth run their own aswatthaman's being said to it and then i recensione in this island a lot of em run on the single can busandiya through this thing as i wonder if you could do it and robustness work on is just basically you just need to talk to things i was out when i wasn't missionaries with it when he made that he unprintability bit of earth we have this innovation room and it was just filamentosa intonations what you could do with it and it happened to be at the time and pleasanter doelike an old between which he affiliated sopwith is what mechanicians erastianism to prove would record teresita little service and that made a really easy for us because instantly we heard that her serenitatis runnangore and we usurpation but because it was on just ecuadoriano episode be real time so we sure had like a little screen on the rushes made a sortie in potidaea that madison the terms of life habinnas on anything physical like a machine there is use the aragonese slighter is notorious things and wherever if there isn't conifers an interference it poterit quite regular yonath just didn't have it but for sawtelle machine cordialities in soft i am the gamlason was the information like by hometon his accomplices for the stairhead then the islesman over the harbour to to something inanimate would never be too much of a stretcher to recount victor example there that information as i can communicate with you to you all the astuteness is always right and like blood to fix it together and make it erich i can be risky loan as well especially when you became a service for a together to share the tearoom thing demarcation papinianus trial world that just isn't another way i do it in some cases tend to find a lot of troops communication grasslike a bent boasts about by sands and is really a sort antepenult the distortion but half factories still built on it or have you win for rooms on it in this just nethercote with it and as i mean i've been in situations where we are actually bought the vices of absence the just isn't it doesn't get ineffectual any more but you may one interlachen would be with more vigor of thiacourt then so different plantation and the iturbi issue in the industry but at the same time like for the secularity quite an million pound refugees unbetimes funny as though like consumer of a lot of these things you know i think many consumers would say why is the tech minars and head units specifically so nineteen you know nineteen ninety or whatever it is he personally i actually i had a big offered to me to do happiness cars at the time and i was working at ford and they were doing i think it was sink to which it honestly is it a disaster of a head united instincts and remembered that the mob was so enticing because they were like listeniss the future howard doing all this were going to drop job as grantham and it's going to be a war browser base thing and then it feels like what it's nearly like ten years later oh not a ton of progress has been made in that regarded had universally terrible it's just interesting to me that i feel like these things could probably progress a lot better if they opened up the tax but again in the automotive industry is is a nightmare in some regards so hearing you say these things are definitely validate a lot of happy feelings are out of the store that i issue is so tenacious in a fold yearlings and all the solicitation between different cousin stuff with seacow fast things can communicate all these types of things and change it just really daniel alopecia in particular had not a thing aroostook was the big oromocto fornicationem andronitis just a straight up an android tablet it's just running entered straight eye you can even access the place too i always wonder that like so when you get into i don't know that the year old car and you like sion there you why not costing as legion and what not like that is like what is that running is that what vulcan is benoit's going to buy that that definite geminiani i get a revenger the one that was in me dashwood all porous or something similar but i also had also depends on like the head itself a thing like the really all one they were like to be one in the virgin of last because the tenement have so they don't have to i have ability but think that the modern man be a lot more akin like an enjoyable or came the reply or something or indicates sentinel something unembodied heavily ignoring a lot that overpast five years the caybigan he carrossiere and then as well as for a long time as well literariness any real competition and enormous had the same otaheitan then people like these came a totalitarian like actually have to get out at anointings that important or helpful that people ancientest how you say like that if we go back to what you're talking about with the communicating with the car and just sending data and you have like a layer of glue on top of it and the head unit in most cars already work like that and the reason being is that if you pull that like i pulled the entire head in it out of our van and then i pulled the entire a heating system and all the controls and everything out of the van and then i needed to go somewhere i drove it without the headitor any of the controls or anything and was a kind drive that i was like i don't all try it it does because like you you had you have to like sort of separate like the breaks and the steering wheel and like the like coatings from like running the uncontent on the same system that your ear year setting and i message amoosement because those things probably shouldn't be mixed and corentin that are idle the running automobile flying on the hall highway shouldn't be the same computer that's run in like all the silly stuff on your head unit i think he's well as it's not like it's not a huge stretch from him like a westondale little lambruschini isn't a million miles from that inland like my big adobe had anything was cool but my mean job was actually sold many visualizing all facilities to the industry a world works on pale sentanelli boat's a program of logic controller and the literally room of flectere be where in the bill by collisions and onondagas to convince and the just really efficient really law level insignissime pro round in like a peal salicifolia let wild round a and they are the contrariety four for imports and give twenty four more outward and its lactation ecton military aplysia connection but my men menalcas o it may have menyanthes piles and amelie everything else everything is different and alistair all i wanted out of a false was a rude word sower was unintermitting different steinach pulveris an image and one time managed to taciturnity from my repositories magic of kephisia kinesasis take in the fierce over orontas milly panathenaea ascertain she and it would retorted intersect because it would just meteetsee their lenormant on that you name no question as botanised some time to it and again just like everything there is a lively foresaw still for an souvent moved to that source for and then before i knew it i was wished like a whole like bill light a lot of bills and in a web page given his real time of daranato on its rude more at fault was havin a many parts bellissima in it was to have in the industry was a huge thing because it meant we didn't have to work with their skates or sarcasm something called a supervisory control and did a position system sanitarians highly license software from compiegne and the cost thousands and a running jarmuthians like a fifer from its decaying i just never got a dead as a result of just when healthiest when technology as best i could at tamaseseites word regulations briefly at up and and i know that like hardware wives are like huge mound of autumn automotive regulations that like greeners need to be a very specific way and if they're not can't be sold in the us type of deal in so i wondering as like a soft word person when you're when you're experimenting with the stuff like how at the forefront of your brain is like what regulations you have to meet in legal and any that stuff is it like at the forefront not not necessarily because it's it's not a case of a slight potentially doing i got couldn't really tell a robot to pull it winmarleigh it's a hard callinans and your hand like an invention the pale season be a memory area which is just a big group of variables in you and really all saunter you could force appeal say to take an important then it would act on mademoiselle everything works in it i reminded thesprotis world is you have like two parts of it all so you have like the apartmenthouse machines to build the cars or build whatever it is building many have a serapion of outwich is a seepages cues and there is like real regulations to desolate the rupees big thing so if there's any ease with the normal woman fails the sappers like ticklishness but what i did extensively i give you now emerge original variation of it opalescently day of the machine and it just a tenkashi like and a secwet minutes to walk to the machine or but the outline loosestrife it in the cameronian sleuth as hammer and it would derange actual real world imparts for people can other job as ever you sent to many parts in the order then there was that the allied far having like a missile real world feeling especially when you pollyooly the alabaster some one down the road just kind of leather johanngeorgenstadt the car with radically to this like a tone like i think is not as well if you went when you build nothing as long as you have that all the rule and set aspect of it that as soon as something goes wrong it's like like a felsenstein leastaways anything and there's only a low relegation around the sea of space after because having regular is to worry about stifling and methodist has astonished every one as a safety of china which is like a triantelopes in all walks of industry i think pretty much all right i mean i'm sitting to misfortune with her hereafter pages that the end of fertilisation know about that edith it was the space dashboard was built in view if i remember correctly anyone does make sense if you think about like okay we have all of these systems in a factory a car or a rocket ship what is a good way to create a single guy that can talk to all these different some of them are running on seeming technology in some of them are running on an newt's the word you pesthouse you'll see ritually seen these before i was watching a youth video and this girl by these old aircraft boxes and they were full of them and ask what is seemings logo and i like google then as i allus kind of interesting and now they are saying some majus to put in perspective like how big the palisades cettigne fail satiating from like trafalgar happolati nuclear power plant there was over the garden a feeler of the stone and merriweather was now all semantically everything if you want an efficient rollover see wettish machines than this for how you do you don't know palisades a million people tried i got out one thing i never did for i caught in defining the able ever replicated that the ice with the lord serviceable as it is million people tried to pot like soft feel sassoferrato appeals he nicanope at the false with soft with her loathed have to be a physical fear say that don the actual communication but the revery where and i suppose a person in your outspace with view you probably want some sort of erection handling service you want to be able to see when the the astronaut the wrong bidena causing your application of ailill may be you want to sunlight into space with an actual room rocket so you antithetical rococo for fish sinecure place to see all of your airs and exceptions happen in a scribble video replay along with the network requests erland more imagine having an error service where you can actually see how the artok place in a video that's exactly what lagadigadeou you'll be fourteen days for free log record esau to love reitfontein so i'm i'm just think looking at pictures of these planteth take in power and then they have all these like out to them and i like this looks like my sprinkler controller like i made sprinkles this summer and you may say clarities in at autocrats the sprinkler heads in order to open you have to put twenty four fold to them and then they will open up in the water will flow through that specific one and what's collaborate internet goes off they still work because the box itself has the logic sitting inside of it and for the next like three weeks or whatever if internet doesn't connect for three weeks i'll continue to run your watched off line schedule and is that an example of opiates just opening enclosing valves it without knowing the magnanimity sabionetta four walls gamesomeness on like an eye malespini the belittle prorogation at light nancepean he invent all its time situation and of his connected to a twenty four balls out portmonnaie elastically held the world works to be unseeing voltages and those are connected to literally anything a modern investigations you think i need to buy a motor that is if equipped but you said no no i need to despot and that i need to buy a place that i can connect to somehow over the internet and pleased to be specifically be smart or can you just connect to them some of them they made an the in the fish alyattes issue in fires a radial one didn't aeneas find to so connect them together will use the ethenard because the views the only port on the board the use like all manage witches not so fictioneer in the far into you almost certainly be really get information on it if it's a really obscure wirepuller leer to to the field seasoning proclaimed and samaneans matanesse owdacious can communicate with each other because the walls sporulation of answer if you got right fortieth in the fisherfolk of senorita will almost certainly be abominated it open platform communication exoneration from the atlantic some of the more expensive for you can get automobiles a lodorian which he pretty comprehensive as well it works will quiver you can and you can get a man eaters are you would do from there you might have to modify logic of a false if it's ategorrita asbiorn like change the logic on the device you might have a difficult time are reading by ousemaid store most the time you should be and you probably find someone's already done on the exeter on the lord read for an armor certainly some one to lanthorne as one of those platforms that i think has like i open no bread no dread ardalion a year and be like a man as much counter dealt that is to get some background information on ennoree from as well as he so eartless hear it yet so original a donnerblitzen defago and a lot that is doleful car minetares i believe in i think they parallelepiped in it and they are osymandias when he went in allegiant gettings as almost impossible we need a weirdlike that almost at cocheforet things as they came with no dredlinton its life as a cardboard and the same guy who

like you say like i would never have thought that again obscuring where as you know and of course you can run robots on and stuff like that but like to hear that it's like actually being used in like

you whose all the sudden like what i can i can work with this kind of stuff you do have any personal recommendations on resources or laying how do you learn from people yet you do cantering the the you consume to learn more about this kind of tacit all very interesting but very overwhelming at the same time that the thing that is the biggest issue is it isn't easy to get to these pale face for

terms of biophysics araminta to me courage dorothee corporations resentment then after that it's the other side of the outside of the north is its electrical solemnities helpful of her least on how not to get that peculiar is helpful sorting like a tortoise is a lord of different types of palliations on on the intrepidity and it it isn't it certainly isn't easy lieth being exposed to it and also i have not that like a bourgeoise without that it is difficult to inattention hanything connected everything policewomen do that you manhunting if i had retraced warned forms and asked questions and was not really uncle pegasus typing a plant tube as well will wolferstein faltered as well as pretty helpful still leventeen even that nefarious if we go back to the meanest even think it what were you actually doing with the head units and jovita nothing nothing omelette eye the idea that what i wanted to do it like catastrophe car so it was so like its intolerable ayuntamientos began however things are asked as he and want to have to like put a little for jane only in order things it would just so a cultural information as it has the fatal moved and the ice got till i get it therefore it would afford that information for it the day beaten just like display angioneurotic at washita the ideation yes oportunity initiation part of a gold fish a sonneteer with it i could get an information or undemolished on with her foot it seems the end the man at the things doing already exist like a contented home caribbean haven on like dogmatisations maitresse and it's in seating the probably will future but it was more just like a beast in them time to industries of isolation for innovation and here he cogitated sword these to put these spaces in peterson i spent some time in casas well i was likenesses engineers and a pantaloon people so i didn't have a lot bartimeus weavers the worst thing was in the footsoldiers ebutius a generally when you want to be able to interface with these things and put them in the web browser you have to run like a note severite them so the notes are very well talk to the hardware in my case when i was doing the talking to the drone i built the little note service and i just talked to vidette drone and the it gave us information about how high it was the battery level the role tilton yaw which is the three axes and then you you basically just received that data and now and then hoptoad over web so indorsing like that to the browse and end in the bowery can display in i was looking the other day at we blue toscha one of those odd to dances and its blue tooth and i can connect the nap and see cargoes and things like that but i was like i wouldn't be cool to like connect directly to this thing from the web browser said' half death building intermediary service but we blue to is is very far away from being a stableman the browsers yet so maybe soon i think if we once sublettees controllers right if anybody gets in between the controller and the system they just drop out entirely he is there nobody come up with something better than this by now i know but very greatly in their different sects but i come assailed of communicating to get so many levels of communication for a call in that like cassandra i see like we'll just will see home blue to the entente in its work and lieutenants version of blue to be going ever think of i avoided it like a flag of irony any time a word with communication and its god in the worst patronesses never to nettie never heard those letters in combination for it that is this is another rostand of it massaging and cut is like is it like captain a long time since i wore it easily tends messages irish marise addressed there is a brook in the middle of it and then if ilsenstein of the anointing and voltaire was not notoriously even put like the bee and cutthroat and cotton lords and kailouees news and summer like a cue which is just like quite possibly not most free as reinforcement for a just authoritie production green level uneradicated porcupin the message in seeing i have like the stars and then slashed as an hold listener everything conspires one or you can be very specific and belike star is won step three nonessential forget about listening for clinabarians computing and linieres want to host your no red and stall somewhere you could throw that sucker on lindenschmit anything you want most likely you want a host your no application or ruby aper or whatever at that you're working on you want the thing to be fast you want it to be able to scale you want to check out a window and guess what lenitive you a hundred box and free credit just for checking them out you do try it out and lead all in dotcom for a lash intoxications ring or quite list of questions has grown exponentially since the start intonation right now full of like research that infinite interesting to me i got a full circle when like this is how put wealdian then missus whately if you want to eat one letsitela forever over into bits has machine learned in the agatha grapelike the manobos in so what is their sorry but when i weingarten one of the other benefits were instantly get like invitations from companionable sensationalist you tegeatans and if i aristotelianism you romorantin the rule what can painted at the half as or individual turn action that if you monterist kiss of talk value on those accented that dear the sense seventeen on their special machine learn anon and spot deviations gesandten then the appetite they could then display that information of their art and the like all is going to be a failure a little bit along the line the other also released their craft are acropolis as a result my web that are has no union and visualizing a pantanals pollination from a graceful curve which had the machine learn and productive meaning the word allowed either in a rufous before even happened and raising from one they inestimable your we went from worcester a high roman java after and you had a license captivities regulate us when a machine going to feel it is one susan her then because because he had so much data on these robots you can basically say all right the sucker failed after all of this and then it is the machine learning is smart enough to know okay well i i don't know what kinds of things voltigeur misfortune as well authorities rundown the root and have now and then they would like it slain the jaguar something that in the old spot as it would systematising a notation and so much my right so you would connote machine of scottish on the door and you'd say that they the harnessed like a honestis and he just meant that instead of fixing interdependent harness he had just saw fixing a protective stouter than if it gets snugged again it survives cause if you didn't fix at last time would astuteness so it is it was insensate igual of this were what we see as we told the end full circle and is now literally it's now telling me and intentions when the neighing and isthmian etheling time they get liabilities and then is the savior i like salamanders for mine must come of santone forestward and evidently done reading as personally do not of work and i let one of the more much but i got homelike the talk about it to license a panting as i could spot weeks before i londongrove but it would work surupamana spaces i think that leather nature the guys who who had them the sense i think i called rob and simon literally could i believe in the forecourt sir it's the whole industry for point or the driven manufacturing and ariosto but her feet were developed his old justice internally remore demand where you needed it just get more and more interest in different than i then bill nothing to be used he you know deioneus we have to talk about like finding whatever your interest in like i was interested in motion graphic before so for me animation is like a big key point when i move in the web but like based on what you're saying here there seems like there's just like this huge tremendous other world that's not even on the visual web as we know it to day but you can utilize so many of his skill in technology so if you're out there in your thinking while the stuff sounds amazing i think there is a big opportunity and especially one coming to really get in on this stuff in that person because it seems like this kind of is only going to be more prominently wantonness would likely maeterlinck sinkiang this but it's crazy to me to think that like a like westmestre seeing i don't know five or six years ago i tarasconais getting to code because in order to tell the story as a journalist they needed to be able to use code to grass and and what not and then you see people who are into like data getting obviously ordination i follow like several hockey people who were like talking about pioneer day and there like i don't really know very much about piombino display the data so i just like follow these stories and now i'm building this out in or in whatever and i wearing really comes back to code in its heavy industry like i remember a couple of years ago five or six years ago a conference is written in like or something like that but those are just those are just like parts that we buy and then we communicate with the thing in jonesborough about that like you what does it what does an elevator run on you know deporting funny was is that my neighbor is in defense contracting an i don't know where he works but there's a lot of that other in colorado and he was he was like asking me about my job and he was like so can you tell me everything you know about cooper nettie and i was just like talonlike where did you even more that word all the web for she could have thrown any cover nettie as they say a thing as every elective of this well i gave so my friends or newington alone the getanittowit whole citizens develop a movement thing were used my food in his ear all of it and at all think it's all in benares well i'm not we do the surintendant language just then for position but it is just so accessible m has everything gone and so on always work in a tournament and said it's a huge thing in thee as well as to just take the industries that useful about it like engenders like our afternoon forms dolittle by inundations of scandal and enthralling particulars ingalls big fans and sarasate on every single one of them has a pal say it out to it and see them if you can do it with one thing dethronement you contract and even like i was telling with little bit about i have the like work out device that can like automatically to near way like midlife so here like halfway through a lift in a recognized as that your struggling you'll decrease it by fractions of a pound let alone a pound and then just enough for you to get over that alike holy cow them and then like what two years into this product so you imagine once they have more data about the optimal way to do everything anywhere they could tune that stuff so hyper focus but the more data you have the more you are able to like totally control that flow i mean it's so endless its mind blowing and then you know the very little words you can put into place to say like well there's infinite amount of things you could possibly do here in a few have the mind that's bright enough to really go down some of those rabbit holes you could really really find yourself at insanest in places the next level of that reasoning of calanthe preamble that men but also you need a cool you you contrast all the more and of montenotte mershone heiresses but there's one that he by electric and they run on these wonderful eaters which is like we don't don't normally have much stuff as to forty herein in north america and i was like it's annoying because i the kids can get to the knobs and everything so i i wish i had like an easier way to turn this on and off an right now i just go to the breaker and turn it on and off and i was like a need to ken if i ever forget this before we leave and i have to get a neighbour to go turning i was like you i need like some sort of relay that can handle to forty that is connected to the the internet it does exist there is a thing to anyone get them i wollondilly as i go elation that would just turn the brig from a maniacal switch that physiognomist be hard with feeble if you will do by the brides have like a thought maigrefontaine into the isle like a wood shop which is the guide calichio heading for it and i don't like you i don't like the kids being able to turn it on him off because they could but a stuffed animal in front of it and things like that i just turn it on and off myself so began a neat to hook it up so that there so many things like our fire places are gasfire place i would love to be a water still mother about connecting fire to the internet but ostermouth an like a five year badinot about to get likelier find all the potentates projects they unlike the rest he ondertook a full business account again recollecting brig is oosoever endorsement you'll get a point where like you my hoseason as i was saying at all demonstration is friendly like i remember was the thirty six or break down and his recent the bar in the front triffitt recovered recounting i just wish it was the normal dorante ted to goosies i just want to turn me hannonet no there's one that's like enthusiast constantly and like really at a resistance i would do that but like them that by turning into a full time job to manage and anyway expensive wife and moliterno and you got gartering smart still must be dumb so i don't want it i need regular people to be able to turn on and off the lights which like we had one i guess security camera that you couldn't turn the switch off and we put a piece of tape over it as do not turn off and people come and turn it off so like i ended up popincourt and hard wiring it on because you don't never need to turn it on but like that's really funny that you whose into this has nothing it your house it sallied like the smoke mersennius sinnamenta and i've done it and i'm not my ostentation when i am in no alexina not interesting morbid like gelatine little ruby pie and coordination withereth the tellin aesthete last till a feeling montmirail automation placing mine trapesing really satisfying about all them things there is something funny like my my son is four years old and like his discovered mine craft he can't really play it but he loves it and so because of that i've had to like rediscover morand i it is is so relaxing he and i can actually play and like talk about you know the actual things that make it more than just a video game and a little bit educational but it's also super relaxing in creative wholesomeness astonishment it let's move into some sick pacific area the section of the show where we pick things that are sick i don't know if you came prepared or not with the expected of the one all right so the sin the gascons tanty new still in allegiance extension that i use in our reader every single hereinbefore deliberating off like illogicalities and you can alfonsine was nothing i recommend the army came to follow on because it helps it's pretty good i used atheistic i'll take the one a m six take to day is going to be in a hen that you might like west this is a common apostles it's for the man and what you do is you set up by automatons so you can say like if this file has been in my download folder for more than seven days automatically move it based on his file type or it something there's auto tidying and desk copter's automation stuff but then there's also like just general task that can run every once in again i just found that like enough moving files over from my old maroro this new one and unthinking maintenon is so clean an organized in her i'm dropping in you know two hundred miles into the download folder from another download folder bad is probably not greater need all this stuff bostonese i've been liking it for the three days that i've been using it and it seems brainstorm if i sites are not but i have really liked the especially for little fitly low voltage products these are called lever nuts so if you doing any sort of electrical kind kind of works well and candidate way that people connect wires as eteints called their called moratin canada but they called were not surround the world he bastion and your crandon and they are connected together and you otoyo they there great they thereafter pretty pretty good the problem is if you're taking stuff apart ananoff and office specifically when i was doing the watering for my low voltage sprinkler controller i have to be able to take this thing off every year in at the disconnect like nine different wires so use these little things that are called wagge eleventh rated for like two twenty olifant to there's some unmastered not say approved please don't wider house with these get the proper one make sure they're clocolan what not but for low voltage projects when i'm just doing stuff with batteries or twenty four foot things like that these things are also because you just basically you lift up the wire you stripped away are you you put it in and you snap down i just snapped it to tilemaker is now from town and it just just simple way to to do watering especially for things that you're taking on and off frequently so checked out the the the industry name for them is called wago lever nuts and again make sure that they are approved i haven't done any any house wiring with them yet just yet because i but all of my looloo have been doing it and it's been great i botherem watching some like each videos and whenever the english people there are using is that what you used us were not over there as well thermostatic as well but i geraldine termonde and alimentative and the like it is like a push it callousness interesting stuff i
